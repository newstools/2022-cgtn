The Governor of Illinois J.B. Pritzker on Monday declared a public health emergency due to the monkeypox outbreak, and declared Illinois a "disaster area" regarding the disease. The declaration will "ensure smooth coordination between state agencies and all levels of government, thereby increasing our ability to prevent and treat the disease quickly," Pritzker said in a press release. California Governor Gavin Newsom later in the day also declared a state of emergency as part of the state's ongoing response to the monkeypox outbreak, adding that the proclamation will support the work underway by the California department of public health to seek additional vaccines and lead outreach and education efforts on accessing vaccines and treatment.
