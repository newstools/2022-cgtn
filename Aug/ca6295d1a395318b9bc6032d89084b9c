Three cyclists were taken to hospital after a serious crash involving Team England's Matt Walls and the Isle of Man's Matt Bostock along with several other riders during the second heat of the men's scratch race at the Commonwealth Games on Sunday. "Following a crash at the morning session of track and para track cycling at the Lee Valley VeloPark, three cyclists and two spectators have been treated by the onsite medical team," a Birmingham 2022 spokesperson said in a statement. "The three cyclists have been taken to hospital. The two spectators did not require hospital treatment," it added. The remainder of the morning session was cancelled and spectators were asked to leave the velodrome after the crash. The Olympic omnium champion Walls, 24, competing in the men's scratch qualifiers at the London venue, received treatment for more than 40 minutes before being taken away by ambulance. Walls was trying to avoid riders who had fallen in a crash lower down the banking, but he clipped another wheel and went over the top. Team England said later that Walls had been discharged with stitches in his forehead, but "thankfully no major injuries." Witnesses said that, because of the gradient of the banking, spectators in the front row had been unsighted for the crash. A total of eight riders went down on the last lap of the race, with medics and coaches immediately rushing to help. Spectators were also hurt after Walls and his bike came over the top of the barriers on the high banking at a corner of the track. One man received treatment for cuts to his arm while a young girl also received medical attention.The session resumed with the men's sprint quarter-finals. Most of the events at the Commonwealth Games are being held in Birmingham but the track cycling is taking place in London. (With input from Reuters)
