Bulgarian President Rumen Radev set October 2 as the date for the country's fourth parliamentary election in less than two years on Monday, after the collapse in June of reformist Prime Minister Kiril Petkov's coalition government. Radev also appointed former labor minister Galab Donev to lead a caretaker government to serve from August 2 until a new government is formed after the election. Radev will outline the priorities of the new government on Tuesday, his office said in a statement.
