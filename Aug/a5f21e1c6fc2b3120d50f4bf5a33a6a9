The protest on the roof at Hawke's Bay Regional Prison in New Zealand has ended after the last four youth inmates jumped off and surrendered to authorities on Tuesday afternoon local time, according to the New Zealand Herald newspaper. Initially six youth inmates, aged 17-19, occupied the roof of a prison building and threw wood and other items on teams trying to enter the building. Two got down earlier on Tuesday morning. Chief Custodial Officer of Department of Corrections Neil Beales said there was no threat to the wider security of the prison or to public safety. An investigation will be launched into the cause of the protest.
