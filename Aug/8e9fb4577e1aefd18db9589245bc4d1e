U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has begun a tour of Asia that has sparked controversy over reports she may visit the Chinese province of Taiwan. In a press release, Pelosi said her delegation would travel to the Indo-Pacific to "reaffirm America's strong and unshakable commitment to our allies and friends in the region." What's she hoping to accomplish from the trip, and what would happen if she did visit Taiwan, a move Beijing has strongly warned against? For some thoughts on these, CGTN's Dong Xue spoke to Cheng Li, a senior fellow at the John L. Thornton China Center of the Brookings Institution.
