The nature of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to the Taiwan region is not about democracy, but is an issue about China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Wednesday. She told a press briefing that the countermeasures China will take in response to the visit will be "resolute, forceful and effective."
