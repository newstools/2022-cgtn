The "willow bay" in Taiyanghe National Forest Park in Pu'er City is an unfrequented place rich in vegetation. It is home to the slope willow, whose towering canopy has nothing in common with "drooping like fringes of a robe" as described in an ancient poem. The horizontal, gnarled branches and thick, chapped bark remind people that this is a willow.
