The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Tuesday firmly opposed and strongly condemned U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region in disregard of stern warnings from the Chinese side. "The HKSAR Government resolutely safeguards China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and upholds the one-China principle. Pelosi's visit constitutes gross interference in China's internal affairs, seriously undermines China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, wantonly tramples on the one-China principle, greatly threatens the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, severely undermines China-U.S. relations, and will lead to a very serious situation and grave consequences," a spokesperson for the HKSAR government said in a statement. HKSAR Chief Executive John Lee and Chief Secretary for Administration Chan Kwok-ki also expressed firm opposition to Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region.
