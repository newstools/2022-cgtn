Baya weavers are best known for their elaborately woven nests with bulbous chambers and narrow tubular entrances built by their male "architects," as they are doing here at a park in Navi Mumbai, India. It takes about 18 days to complete a nest. The males begin courting the females when the nest is partially built, and they complete the job by adding the entrance tunnel when they find a mate. Sometimes, they build a nest at the base of the first one if it is not chosen by the female. There could be two to three or even four nests. Baya weavers can be found across the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. Nearly 10,000 can be found in Changning County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. (All photos via CFP.)
