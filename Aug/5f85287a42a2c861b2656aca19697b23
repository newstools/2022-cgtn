The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) vehemently denounces any external force's interference on the issue of Taiwan, and fully supports the Chinese government's just stand to resolutely defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity, a DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesperson said on Wednesday, according to the Korean Central News Agency. Commenting on U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region, the spokesperson said "Taiwan is an inseparable part of China and the issue of Taiwan pertains to the internal affairs of China. It is the due right of a sovereign state to take counter measures against the moves of the outside forces openly interfering in its internal affairs and destroying its territorial integrity." "The current situation clearly shows that the impudent interference of the U.S. in internal affairs of other countries and its intentional political and military provocations are, indeed, the root cause of harassed peace and security in the region. The U.S. scheme to disturb the growth and development of China and its efforts for accomplishing the cause of reunification is bound to go bankrupt," the spokesperson added.
