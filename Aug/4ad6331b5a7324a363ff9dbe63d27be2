China on Monday unveiled a plan to promote green growth in the industrial sector to help the country achieve carbon peak goal by 2030. By 2025, the energy consumption per unit added value of industrial enterprises with an annual business turnover of at least 20 million yuan ($2.96 million) will decrease by 13.5 percent compared with 2020, according to a plan released by the country's Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, National Development and Reform Commission, and Ministry of Ecology and Environment. Efforts will be made to promote the optimization and upgrading of industrial structures, curb the blind development of low-level projects with high energy consumption and high emissions, and develop green and low-carbon industries, the plan noted. By 2030, the proportion of new vehicles powered by new energy and clean energy will reach about 40 percent, according to the plan. Meanwhile, the carbon dioxide emissions intensity of passenger cars will decrease by 25 percent, and that of commercial vehicles by 20 percent compared with 2020. The plan said digital technologies would be further leveraged to accelerate the green and low-carbon transformation of the industrial sector.
