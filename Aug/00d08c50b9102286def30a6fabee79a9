The U.S. House of Representatives is expected to unveil legislation to ban stock trading for lawmakers in early August, according to Reuters last Thursday. Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her family have come under scrutiny for several market trades in recent weeks. Her husband, Paul Pelosi, has traded and profited from Tesla, Apple, Google and other technology stocks. Pelosi has repeatedly said that she had nothing to do with these transactions.
