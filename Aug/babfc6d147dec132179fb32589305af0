Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday the country will not rejoin the International Criminal Court (ICC). The Philippines officially informed the United Nations in March 2018 about its decision to withdraw from the Rome Statute of the ICC after the body launched an investigation into the alleged extrajudicial killings related to former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte's anti-drug campaign in which more than 6,000 people died in the war on drugs. Marcos, speaking at a local event on Monday, added that local investigations into Duterte's anti-drug campaign are ongoing.
