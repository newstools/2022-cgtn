Aymara Gerdel, the director of the China-Venezuela Research Center for a Shared Future Community, said in an interview that Nancy Pelosi's visit to Taiwan region is a rude interference by the U.S. in China's internal affairs, and the Taiwan question is closely related to the U.S. midterm elections in November. She also pointed out that American hegemony in the world is not welcomed.
