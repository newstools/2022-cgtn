Procuratorial organs across China have intensified legal protection of the legitimate rights and interests of servicemen and their families, said Yuan Ming, head of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP) Second Procuratorial Office, at a press conference on Friday. Procuratorial organs have prosecuted 1,026 people in 661 military-related cases from 2021 to June 2022, according to the SPP. Yuan said military procuratorial organs have been focused on safeguarding national defense and military interests since 2018, and carried out military-related judicial assistance, in collaboration with local procuratorial organs, to protect the rights and interests of veterans, service personnel and their families. For instance, a total amount of 797,000 yuan (around $118,000) has been provided as judicial assistance to veterans, service personnel and their families by Jiangsu procuratorial organs last year. The country's top procuratorate said it had issued four documents since 2016 to strengthen the construction of military and local procuratorial cooperation. At present, 25 military procuratorates have established a cooperation mechanism with their local provincial counterparts. A law on the protection of the status, rights and interests of military personnel took effect on August 1, 2021.
