Bill Russell, one of the greatest legends in NBA history, passed way in peace on July 31, at the age of 88 years old. Having played 13 seasons in the league, he led the Boston Celtics to the NBA Finals 12 times and won 11 titles, including eight in a row. The NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award was named after him, and he was the one delivering the trophy on most occasions. Russell was a five-time NBA Most Valuable Player, four-time rebounding champion, 12-time All-Star, three-time All-NBA First Team selection and an eight-time Second Team member. He was named to the All-Defensive First Team right after the honor was presented in the 1968-69 season. The NBA didn't count blocks until the 1973-74 season. Neither was the Defensive Player of the Year (DPOY) Award was given before the 1982-83 campaign. If Russell were in those two eras, he would have been both the blocks leader and DPOY multiple times. May the most legendary Celtic and the greatest defensive center rest in peace. Host: Li Xiang Guest: Matthew Watson Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
