Chinese women's professional golfer Feng Shanshan announced her retirement on social media on Tuesday. Before Tuesday's announcement, the 32-year-old golf pro was appointed as the head coach of the Chinese women's national team. "I will utilize my international experience, combined with the real situation in China, to find my coaching system that fits the Chinese golfers best," said the former world No.1. "I will also devote myself to youth training and golf popularization in China," added Feng, who grabbed 22 titles in international tournaments, including 10 on the Ladies Professional Golf Association (LPGA) Tour. She won the Omega Dubai Ladies Masters in 2012, 2014, 2015 and 2016. In November 2017, she became the women's world No. 1 and stayed atop the rankings for 23 weeks. "I'm very proud of my career achievement, for those years as a golf pro, I would give myself full marks," said Feng.
