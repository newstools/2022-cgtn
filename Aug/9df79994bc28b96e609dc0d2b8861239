Many people may have heard of Dongling Mountain, the highest peak in Beijing, but few know of Beiling Mountain, about 8 kilometers northeast of Dongling. It has the same magnificent mountain cliffs and matcha-colored alpine meadows decorated with seas of flowers. Both mountains are crowned as Beijing's backyard gardens, reminding people of the cartoon world created by Japanese animator Hayao Miyazaki. Beiling Mountain has multiple names. On the map, it is often marked as Jiushan Mountain, while the name "Beiling Mountain" was actually given by hikers. It also has a nickname – Jiucai Mountain, because many wild Chinese chives grow on the mountain slope. In Chinese, "Jiucai" means Chinese chives. Summer is the best season to visit Beiling Mountain.
