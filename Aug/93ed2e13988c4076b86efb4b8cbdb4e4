China will continue to provide COVID-19 vaccine assistance to Tajikistan and build a China-Tajikistan community with a shared future, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday during a meeting with Tajik Foreign Minister Sirojiddin Muhriddin. China firmly supports the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Tajikistan, as well as the country's efforts to follow a path of development in line with its own national conditions, Wang said. China expects to build long-term, mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, Wang added. The trade volume between the two sides grew amid the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, and is expected to reach a record high this year, Wang said, adding both sides should implement the signed economic cooperation plan and expand cooperation in emerging fields such as digital economy, new energy and high technology.  China will keep working on important projects aimed at helping Tajikistan, and continue the smooth operation of the first Luban Workshop, a project designed to provide technical and vocational training, in Central Asia. China will also strengthen cooperation in traditional medicine with Tajikistan and build a traditional medicine center, Wang added. Muhriddin thanked China for providing vaccines, and said he hopes to enhance cooperation between the two sides in the fight against COVID-19. Tajikistan admires China's achievements in poverty alleviation and innovation, and hopes to learn from China's experiences to achieve its own sustainable development and accelerate the industrialization process, he added. Both sides also exchanged views on cooperation between China and the five Central Asian countries.
