The Macao Special Administrative Region government on Wednesday firmly opposed and strongly condemned U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit to China's Taiwan region. "The Macao Government resolutely safeguards China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity, and upholds the one-China principle. Pelosi's visit constitutes gross interference in China's internal affairs, seriously undermines China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, wantonly tramples on the one-China principle, greatly threatens the peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait, severely undermines China-U.S. relations," the Macao SAR government said in a statement.
