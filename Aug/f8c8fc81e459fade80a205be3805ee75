The Eastern Theater Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Wednesday organized actual combat joint exercises and training around the Taiwan island in response to provocative U.S. actions. The drills featured the Navy, Air Force, Rocket Force, Strategic Support Force and Joint Logistic Support Force in the sea and air space north, southwest and southeast of the Taiwan island, the command said. The PLA announced on Tuesday that it would launch a series of targeted military operations around the island, after U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi landed on the same day for a visit in disregard of China's opposition.
