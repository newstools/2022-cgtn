New Napoli signee Kim Min-jae took it retro with a fun dance after joining the Serie A club this past week. The South Korean national performed "Gangnam Style," the 2012 hit by Korean pop star Psy, for his new teammates. Kim even added Psy's famous horse-riding dance move as the Napoli squad roared in approval. The 25-year-old center-back signed with Napoli on Tuesday after a move from Turkey's Fenerbahce.
