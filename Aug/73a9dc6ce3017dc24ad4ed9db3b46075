In a People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy test and training area, an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) station recently completed a high-precision target recognition mission, launching multiple attacks on weapons and equipment platforms to test ultimate performance. After the target drones took off, they quickly adjusted their flight attitude and prepared to launch attacks upon entry into the target area. On the ground, telemetry and remote control operators worked closely together to ensure the precision of each drone maneuvering along intended routes. On each mission, important data such as attitude, altitude, and the speeds of target missiles and aircraft must be dynamically monitored and adjusted in real time. By moving the joystick, the navy soldiers can capture and track high-speed moving aerial targets. The PLA Navy's exponential development in combat capability has created heightened expectations for target recognition capacity, support and innovation.
