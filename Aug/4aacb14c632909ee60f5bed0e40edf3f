As China-U.S. tensions flare up over the Taiwan Strait, the business community is watching with apprehension. Taiwanese exporters with extensive investments on the Chinese mainland are concerned about getting caught in the crossfire. Liao Chun-ying, a Taiwan entrepreneur based in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, said geopolitical tensions would hurt investment and overall business sentiment. "Harmony is precious," said Liao. She hopes practical concerns will prevail, especially as companies are already suffering from COVID-19, climate change, and rising raw material costs. Meanwhile, some observers said U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned visit to Taiwan was motivated by selfish political calculations and not constructive to China-U.S. relations.
