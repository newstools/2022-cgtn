China's computing power industry, such as the manufacturing of fiber optic cables and data storage devices, achieved an average growth of over 30 percent in the past five years, according to the latest data from the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT). Its total computing power scale now ranks second in the world, MIIT said. The data released at the 2022 China Computational Power Conference held in Jinan, east China's Shandong Province. MIIT said all prefecture-level cities have implemented optical network broadband and the number of gigabit fiber users has exceeded 61 million, building up a a strong foundation for the growth of computing business. As of the end of June, China has about 1.9 million 5G base stations with more than 450 million 5G mobile phone users in the country.

"It's estimated that the production capacity of the data center will exceed 1.17 million units during the year. In 2022, China Mobile's computing power network capital expenditure will be tens of billions of yuan and will continue to increase investment in the future," said Gao Tongqing, vice president of China Mobile.
