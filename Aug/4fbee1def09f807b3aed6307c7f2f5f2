The United States Senate voted to advance a highly-anticipated bill to compete with China in semiconductor production. The legislation is also aimed at addressing a lingering chip shortage and making the U.S. less reliant on other countries for manufacturing. How will the bill affect the U.S. and global chipmaking industry? And how will Chinese semiconductor manufacturers and policymakers react to the bill that prohibits investment in China? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Prof. Liu Baocheng from the University of International Business and Economics; Dr. William Lee, chief economist of the Milken Institute; and Andy Mok, senior research fellow at Center for China and Globalization.
