Argentina, Uruguay, Chile and Paraguay have launched a joint bid for the FIFA World Cup in 2030, football executives and political leaders of the four South American countries said on Tuesday. "One hundred years [since the first World Cup] will be achieved only once. And it has to come back home," South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL) President Alejandro Dominguez said at a press conference. "We believe that is more than enough of a reason for FIFA to accept that this becomes the only bid." Argentina, Uruguay and Chile have all hosted the World Cup before. Uruguay hosted it and won the title in 1930, which was the first edition of the tournament. Argentina hosted the World Cup in 1978 and won the championship for the first time before doing it again in 1986 in Mexico. Chile was the host in 1962 and made it to the semifinals where they lost to the final champions Brazil. The South American quartet will face competitions from a European pair of Spain and Portugal. Spain hosted the World Cup in 1982 when Italy won the title. FIFA will decide the 2023 hosts in 2024, six years before the event. The last time the top global football event happened in South America was in 2014 when Brazil suffered one of the most humiliating losses against Germany 7-1 at home and had to watch Germany and Argentina, their long-term rivals, competing for the title in the final at Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro. The 2022 World Cup will take place in Qatar from November 21 to December 18, for the first time in winter. In another four years, the U.S., Canada and Mexico will jointly host the tournament in 2026 with 48 teams competing.
