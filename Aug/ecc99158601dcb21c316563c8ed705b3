Porcelain repair is an ancient craft in China and used to be a part of people's daily lives. It was portrayed in the painting Along the River During the Qingming Festival from the Song Dynasty (960-1279). Some elderly people still remember porcelain repairmen walking through the streets and calling out for those who have broken porcelain to repair. Nowadays, repairing porcelain is relatively rarely seen. But it still serves an important purpose, when something precious needs to be preserved. For most people, what matters the most is not the historical or monetary value, but what that broken porcelain represents.
