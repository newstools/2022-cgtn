Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi plans to travel to New York for the UN General Assembly next month despite U.S. sanctions against him, the government's spokesman said on Tuesday. "The preliminary planning has been done for the president's attendance at the UN General Assembly session," Ali Bahadori-Jahromi told a weekly press briefing. Raisi, who has been under U.S. sanctions since November 2019, missed last year's General Assembly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
