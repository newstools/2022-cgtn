Talks on the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), were paused temporarily, the European Union (EU) said on Friday. In a statement, the European External Action Service (EEAS) said that the eighth round of negotiations in Vienna will "take a break," giving participants time to go back to their capitals for consultations with their respective governments.
