In a meeting on Thursday, the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee heard a series of works reports from the country's multiple organs, summarizing their endeavors over the past year while calling for future progress. The comprehensive leadership of the CPC and specifically, the centralized and unified leadership of the CPC Central Committee, must be upheld to well govern a giant economy with a population of 1.4 billion people, said a statement released after the meeting. Xi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC Central Committee, presided over the meeting. Hailing last year as a historic year to the history of the CPC and the country, officials from various state organs said they've fulfilled their duties surrounding the overall work of the CPC and the country. Those participants include leading Party members groups of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate, as well as from the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee. CPC leaders urged the party member groups of those state organs to make "progress in stability," while calling for strengthening political judgement, thinking and implementation. All must – in all time – maintain a high degree of unity with the CPC Committee with Comrade Xi at its core ideologically, politically, and in action, they noted.
