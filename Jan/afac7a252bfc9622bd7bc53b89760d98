Birds are one of the world's smartest creatures and choose the most suitable place to perch. Places near rivers, seas or wetlands where there is abundant food to forage are good choices for them. Zhongshan City in south China's Guangdong Province sits in the south of the Pearl River Delta. The warm climate and ample food resources have attracted many migratory and resident birds, and endangered birds such as black-faced spoonbill are also found here. Even the most experienced bird watcher cannot tell how many birds are living in Zhongshan City. Check the video to learn more.
