Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro said he was admitted to a hospital on Monday at 3 a.m. after feeling unwell after lunch on Sunday. Previous media reports said he's being treated for a probable intestinal obstruction. In a Twitter post, the 66-year-old said his doctors are evaluating a potential surgery in his intestine and he is using a nasogastric tube. He also tweeted a picture of himself giving a thumbs up while lying in a hospital bed. Bolsonaro has been hospitalized several times since he was stabbed during his presidential campaign in 2018. In July 2021, he was taken to Vila Nova Star due to an intestinal blockage after suffering from chronic hiccups. (With input from Reuters)
