Russia will station troops on its own territory near the Ukrainian border due to tensions with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Sunday. "We find it necessary to keep those troops due to a very tense situation and very unfriendly environment," Peskov said in a CNN interview. Russia has to take measures of precaution in response to NATO military build-up, drills and frequent flights of fighter jets and reconnaissance planes near the Russian borders. However, Russia is not considering a military action even if negotiations with the United States and NATO on security guarantees fail, Peskov stressed. Nevertheless, Russia is "ready to take countermeasures" if both sides cannot reach a consensus, he said.
