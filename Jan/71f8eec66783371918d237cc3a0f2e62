A massive spill of raw sewage in California on Friday forced the city of Long Beach to close all swimming areas at nearby beaches, Reuters has reported, citing local officials. Long Beach officials revealed in a press release that between 2 and 4 million gallons (7.6 to 15 million liters) of raw sewage had leaked on Thursday into the Dominguez Channel, which empties into Los Angeles harbor.
