Japan's Osaka police on Saturday arrested a 19-year-old male on suspicion of setting a warehouse on fire that burnt for six days. The suspect was working in the warehouse when the fire broke out last November and admitted that he had "lit a fire with a turbo lighter," according to the prefectural police.
