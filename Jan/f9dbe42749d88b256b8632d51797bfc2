More than 2,000 black-necked cranes have arrived in Caohai National Nature Reserve wetlands in Bijie, southwest China's Guizhou Province. The reserve is one of the main habitats of these rare birds from late October to March every year. The largest populations of black-necked cranes are in China, with smaller numbers also found in Vietnam, Bhutan and India. The bird is under first-class protection in China, and regarded as an auspicious and happy symbol in many parts of the country.
