Archaeologists recently discovered a large-scale cluster of ancient tombs dating back over a century in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. The cluster of some 200 tombs is in Dashugen Village, Fucheng Township of Beihai City, according to the museum of Beihai City, and date back to somewhere around the Six Dynasties period (222-589), the Sui Dynasty (581-618) or Tang Dynasty (618-907). Covering an area of 70,000 square meters, the site bears relics such as patterned pottery, ironware and bricks with inscriptions. One of the most prominent features of the cluster is that most of the tomb chambers were constructed with stone pieces, although some tombs were made of brick and stone. Experts said the archaeological discovery is of great research value. The Beihai City Museum at the Guangxi Institute of Cultural Relics Protection and Archaeology has been conducting archaeological exploration and investigation in China's coastal areas in recent years. In 2021, the museum discovered over 10 sites and relic distribution sites, including the Mu Yan Tang Porcelain kiln of Qing Dynasty (1636-1912) and Youhangwu Ruins of Song and Yuan dynasties (960-1368).
