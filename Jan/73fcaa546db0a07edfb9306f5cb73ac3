A dad in Jilin City, northeast China's Jilin Province, turned his frozen-over backyard into an ice rink for his son to play hockey in for four consecutive years. At first, the father was not good at pouring the water to make the rink as flat as possible, and it took four or five days to create the rink. Over time, however, he has grown increasingly skilled at making the icy arena.
