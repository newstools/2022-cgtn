In a fourth test this month, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired two projectiles into eastern waters on Monday, according to the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the Republic of Korea (ROK). The ROK military said in a statement that the projectiles, which are believed to be ballistic missiles, were launched northeastward to the Eastern coast from the DPRK's Sunan airfield in Pyongyang at about 8:50 a.m. and 8:54 a.m. local time, respectively. The projectiles traveled some 380 kilometers at an altitude of around 42 kilometers. The intelligence authorities of the ROK and the United States were analyzing details on them, according to the JCS."Currently, our military is tracking and monitoring related (North Korean) movements and maintaining a readiness posture," the JCS added.The Japanese government also confirmed the launch. The DPRK's Korean Central News Agency confirmed last week that the railway-borne missile regiment test-fired two tactical guided missiles on Friday. The DPRK said it successfully test-launched a hypersonic missile on January 5 and January 11, respectively. ROK's presidential National Security Council later on Monday held an emergency meeting, emphasizing the importance of the rapid resumption of dialogue in order to stabilize situations on the Korean Peninsula.
