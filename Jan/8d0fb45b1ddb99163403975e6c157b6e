World Health Organization Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned on Monday that the conditions remain ideal for more coronavirus variants to emerge, and said it was "dangerous" to assume that "we are in the endgame." He also said the acute phase of the pandemic could still end this year if some key targets are met.
