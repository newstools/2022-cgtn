On the last day of 2021, President Xi Jinping delivered a televised New Year speech where he extended New Year's greetings, reviewed China's achievements over the past year, and expressed his best wishes for 2022. What were some of the highlights of the speech? What were some of the major events in China in 2021? And what can we look forward to in 2022? To help us answer these questions, we've invited Dr. Wang Huiyao, counselor of the China State Council; Michele Geraci, former Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economic Development in Italy; and Einar Tangen, independent current affairs commentator.
