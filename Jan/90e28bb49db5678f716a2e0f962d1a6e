A health check on all 52 in-orbit satellites of China's BeiDou Navigation Satellite System (BDS) has been completed, according to the Xi'an Satellite Control Center. The center said the satellites met all key indicators, meaning the constellation can provide services without issue. The evaluation was conducted without interrupting the satellites' usual navigation services, and developers and users were invited to participate in the process. In addition to the assessment, a bespoke maintenance plan was drawn up for each satellite to ensure operational efficiency. China officially commissioned BDS on July 31, 2020, opening the new BDS-3 system to global users. The BDS can provide diverse services and powerful functions. Globally, it can provide services of positioning, navigation and timing (PNT), global message communication, and international search and rescue. In the Asia-Pacific region, its services include regional short message communication, precise point positioning, and satellite-based and ground-based augmentation.
