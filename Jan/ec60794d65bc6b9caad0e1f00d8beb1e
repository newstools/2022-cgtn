A Japan Air Self-Defense Force F15 fighter jet disappeared from the radar after taking off from the Komatsu Air Base in the central Japanese prefecture of Ishikawa on Monday, Japan's defense ministry said. A person believed to be a crew member was located in the Sea of Japan, with a rescue being mounted, local broadcaster NHK reported. NHK said the jet might have crashed and the Coast Guard had dispatched several boats to search the area. The jet lost radar contact around 5:30 p.m. local time (0830 GMT) while conducting training with a crew of two aboard over the Sea of Japan, about 5 kilometers west-northwest of the base.
