Chen Lu is the first Chinese Olympic figure skating medalist. In the year 1998, she wowed spectators with her performance to Chinese classical piece "Butterfly Lovers," earning her the nickname "butterfly on ice." These days, she coaches young skaters, including her own daughter Anna, to prepare for the Beijing Winter Olympics. CGTN host Tian Wei earlier visited her at her school in Beijing. She still beams with passion both on and off the ice.
