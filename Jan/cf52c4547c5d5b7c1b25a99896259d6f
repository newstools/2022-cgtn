Seven-time Super Bowl champion quarterback Tom Brady will retire after 22 NFL seasons, according to multiple U.S. media reports on Saturday. But the player, his agent and his team have yet to confirm the news. Brady's agent Don Yee told Reuters that people should wait to hear directly from Brady about his plans going forward, amid contradictory reports after later claims that he "hasn't made up his mind" on the issue. Brady wanted to share the news himself but was "definitely" retiring, a report from the USA Today said, citing an anonymous source with direct knowledge of the situation. Brady, 44, is widely considered the greatest quarterback in NFL history. A Northern California native, he was selected with the 199th pick of the 2000 NFL draft and deemed the league's all-time leader in passing yards, passing touchdowns and quarterback wins. He appeared in a record 10 Super Bowls, winning the game's MVP award five times, and his 15 Pro Bowl selections is the most in league history. (With input from Reuters)
