2021 has passed, and we are welcoming a new year. Despite the COVID-19 pandemic which kept a lot of travelers at home in 2021, CGTN Nature crew went to many places and provided our audiences from all over the world with some magnificent "journeys" through our cameras. Now, let's look back at some of the scenery you saw on CGTN Nature during the year. We sincerely appreciate your accompanying and hope you stay with CGTN Nature for more in 2022. Happy New Year!
