The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired an "unidentified projectile" toward the East Sea on Tuesday, Yonhap news agency reported, citing the Republic of Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff. The suspected ballistic missile launch was detected around 7:27 a.m. (2227 GMT) from an inland area of the DPRK toward the ocean off its eastern coast, the JCS said in a statement. It marks the DPRK's second missile test in 2022. The DPRK said last week that it successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile on January 5.
