Nearly one year into Joe Biden's presidency, do people have a better idea of how China-U.S. relations may develop? From the heated exchange between top officials in Anchorage, Alaska to the in-depth and productive virtual meeting between the two leaders themselves, are the relationship being stabilized? How do observers from the U.S. and China assess the general state of their relations now and for the near future? In particular, with U.S. strategic ambiguity and China's "no room for compromise," have the two countries entered dangerous territory over Taiwan? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Ian Bremmer, President of Eurasia Group; Victor Gao Zhikai, chair professor of Soochow University; and Professor Shen Dingli from the Institute of International Studies of Fudan University.
