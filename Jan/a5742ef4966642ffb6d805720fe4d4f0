The situation in Burkina Faso's capital is generally calm for now with no clashes and no report of casualties in the last two days, Wang Wenzhang, Chinese counselor for political affairs in Burkina Faso, told China Media Group on Monday. Mobile network communication in Ouagadougou has been suspended since Sunday. Chinese enterprises, institutions and overseas Chinese in the country have suspended operations in accordance with the safety alert issued by the Chinese Embassy. Earlier, it had been reported that President Roch Marc Christian Kabore was detained overnight by mutinous soldiers at a military camp. But it's still unclear who is in charge of the country at the moment. Wang said around 500 Chinese nationals in the country are in safety, adding the Chinese Embassy will closely follow the development in the country.
