One person has been found and two are still feared dead following a devastating Colorado wildfire that wiped out swaths of several towns and forced thousands of people to flee with little notice, officials said Sunday. Of the three reported missing, "one of those persons has been accounted for alive and well," Boulder County Sheriff Joe Pelle told journalists, adding that a search was ongoing for the remaining two.
