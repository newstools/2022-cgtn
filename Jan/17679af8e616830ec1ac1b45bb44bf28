UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson asserted on Wednesday that the UK should stick with the current so-called Plan B restrictions, and will not impose additional restrictions. He said people in England should continue to carry on working from home, wear face coverings on public transport and in most indoor public places, take a test before going to high-risk venues or meeting the elderly or vulnerable. On Tuesday, the UK surpassed 200,000 daily cases for the first time, recording 218,724 in a single day.
