Late December to late January is the best time to see the cherry blossoms at Jingmai Mountain in southwest China's Yunnan Province. For thousands of years, the ethnic Dai and Bulang people living in the region have maintained the tradition of leaving some native tree species in their tea gardens for shade. The cherry trees are the best choice. The trees not only provide shade, but also a beautiful landscape.
