More than 103,000 people are hospitalized with COVID-19 in the United States, the first time the total has reached six figures in nearly four months, CNN reported on Tuesday, quoting the latest data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. COVID-19 hospitalizations reached a record high of more than 142,000 about a year ago, on January 14, 2021, and last topped 100,000 on September 11, 2021. The total fell to about 45,000 hospitalizations in early November, but increased steadily since then, and surged last week.

An average of 672 children were admitted to hospitals each day with COVID-19 during the week ending Sunday, the highest such number of the pandemic, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In Illinois, that number has almost tripled since December. The hospitalizations are primarily among unvaccinated people. According to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, cumulative hospitalization rates through November are about eight times higher for unvaccinated adults and about 10 times higher for unvaccinated children aged 12 to 17.
