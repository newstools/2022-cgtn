China will provide another one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to African countries, said Chinese President Xi Jinping during his speech at a virtual session of the 2022 World Economic Forum. Xi said China will also donate 150 million doses to members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He reiterated that cooperation is "the only right way" to defeat the pandemic, while holding each other back or shifting blame "would only case needless delay in response" and "distract us from the overall objective."
