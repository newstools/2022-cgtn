Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Ma Zhaoxu on Monday hailed a joint statement issued by the leaders of the five nuclear-weapon states, namely China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States, on preventing nuclear war and avoiding arms races. The five countries reaffirmed in the statement that none of their nuclear weapons are targeted at each other or at any other state, and that a nuclear war cannot be won and must never be fought. Ma said it was the first time that the leaders of the five countries issued a statement on nuclear weapons, and that showed their political will to prevent nuclear war and also sent a shared voice of maintaining global strategic stability and reducing the risk of nuclear conflict. The statement also helps the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council enhance mutual trust and replace great-power competition with coordinated cooperation, said Ma. He added that China had played an important role in facilitating the countries to reach the positive and solid statement. Fu Cong, director-general of the arms control department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, also welcomed the statement, calling it "very pertinent" and "very timely."
