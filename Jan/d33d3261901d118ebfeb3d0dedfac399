China's Wang Xindi, Yang Longxiao and Sun Jiaxu finished top three in the men's aerials event at the International Ski Federation (FIS) Freestyle Skiing World Cup at Deer Valley on Wednesday, while Kong Fanyu was second in the women's event. Wang topped the podium with 122.62 points, while compatriots Yang and Sun scored 112.67 and 83.50, respectively. Kong pocketed 84.58 points, while Pyeongchang gold medalist Hanna Huskova finished third with 82.65 points and Australian Laura Peel won the title with 118.05. China's star skier Xu Mengtao, three-time Olympian and silver medalist at Sochi 2014, did not reach the final on Wednesday due to errors in the qualifying round. Xu was ranked world No.1 before the Pyeongchang Games, but fell short on her third Olympic campaign, after suffering a heavy ligament injury in 2016. Xu, 31, surpassed Australian Jacqui Cooper's record of 25 titles at the Freestyle Skiing World Cup in December 2021, when she clinched the second of her back-to-back victories in the women's aerials event in Ruka, Finland, and later set the record at 27 in Le Relais, Canada, lifting her dream to pursue an Olympic gold medal coming back from injuries and disappointment.
