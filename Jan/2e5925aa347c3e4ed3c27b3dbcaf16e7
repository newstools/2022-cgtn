Beijing's plans to ensure the 2022 Winter Olympics go ahead safely despite the COVID-19 pandemic look strong, WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said as the clock ticks down to the Games, due to begin on February 4. At a news conference on Thursday, Ryan said the United Nations' health agency had worked with the International Olympic Committee to provide technical advice on the safe hosting of the Games. "The Chinese authorities have very strict measures in place, and they've released a series of different playbooks," he said. "I'm confident that given the information we have, that the measures that are in place for the Games are very strict and very strong and we don't, at this point, see any increased risk of disease transmission in that context," Ryan added.
