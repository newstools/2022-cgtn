South Korean champion Cha Jun-hwan warmed up for the Beijing Winter Olympics in two weeks' time with his first gold at the ISU Four Continents Figure Skating Championships in Tallinn, Estonia on Sunday. The 20-year-old led all the way to take a first men's medal in the competition for South Korea ahead of Japanese pair Kazuki Tomono and Kao Miura after the free skate on the final day of competition.Cha overcame a fall on his opening quadruple jump to Puccini's "Turdandot" but picked himself up and completed his routine which included a quadruple Salchow and six triple jumps.The South Korean scored his season's best of 174.26 points for the free skate and 273.22 points overall, with Tomono collecting 268.99 and Miura 251.07."I'm really happy with how I fought through and gave my everything," said Cha, who trains in Toronto with Canadian two-time Olympic medalist Brian Orser. "Today's performance will be a great step for the Olympics and the rest of the season."When I came to this competition I was thinking this will be helpful for the Olympics and the season, not about medaling." Tomono, 23, a bronze medalist in the Grand Prix Rostelecom Cup, missed his second quad jump to the music from "La La Land", but nevertheless set a new personal best of 171.89 for the free skating. Sixteen-year-old Miura pushed through despite a pulled leg muscle to also achieve a new personal best score with 162.70 points for his flamenco routine to music by Spanish guitar maestro Vicente Amigo. Most of the top skaters from Asia and North America skipped the competition before the Winter Olympics in Beijing because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Japan's Mai Mihara won the women's title on Saturday with the United States winning both pairs by Audrey Lu and Misha Mitrofanov, and ice dancing by Caroline Green and Michael Parsons, respectively.
