Former Malian President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita died at 76 on Sunday in Bamako, the capital of Mali, sources close to his family announced. Having come to power in September 2013 and then re-elected in 2018, Keita was overthrown on August 18, 2020, by the National Committee for the Salvation of the People (CNSP) after months of street protests to challenge his regime. Shortly after the coup d'etat that overthrew him, the junta granted him all the benefits for a former president of the Republic of Mali. And since his ouster, he had stayed several times in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, for health reasons.
