Russia's foreign ministry said on Thursday that unrest in Kazakhstan in recent days is a foreign-inspired attempt to undermine the country's state security by force, according to Russian media. "We consider the recent events in a friendly country to be a foreign-inspired attempt to use armed and trained groups of people forcibly to undermine the security and integrity of the state," a statement from Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova read. Zakharova said that Russia will assist Kazakh authorities in stopping the violence and is interested in the soonest restoration of normal life in the country. Russia would consult with Kazakhstan and other allies in the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) on possible further moves to support a "counter-terrorist" operation there and unblock critical infrastructure, the spokesperson added. In a similar tone, Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic also said on Thursday that foreign intelligence services are behind the ongoing mass riots in Kazakhstan. Dissatisfied over surging fuel prices, mass protests broke out across different regions in Kazakhstan in recent days and have led to several deaths including both protesters and law enforcement officers, as well as over 1,000 injuries. Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has instructed to create an investigative group to determine the causes of disturbances in the country and to hold all those responsible accountable as "anti-terrorist" special operation continues in major Kazakh cities. Ministry of Internal Affairs of Kazakhstan said on Thursday that police detained about 2,000 people in Almaty, the largest city in the country. The United Nations said it follows the unrest in Kazakhstan with concern and called for restraint. CSTO on Thursday sent collective peacekeeping forces to assist calm the situation.
