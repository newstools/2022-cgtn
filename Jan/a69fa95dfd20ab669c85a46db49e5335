CGTN's "Music Voyage" Winter Olympics-themed music production "Embrace" was released on Thursday after a month-long collaboration among four musicians in a relay format. Musicians Asr and Mico Liu Wei from China, Doctor Victor from Iceland and Carlo Facchini from Italy were each given seven days to compose a one-minute piece that reflected their musical taste and understanding about winter sports and the Beijing Winter Olympics which begin on February 4. The four musical tracks were then masterfully fused to form "Embrace" – a title decided by an online poll.
