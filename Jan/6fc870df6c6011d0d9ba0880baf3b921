UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned Friday's airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition against a detention center in Yemen's Saada City, said his spokesman. Yemen's Houthi group reported on Friday an airstrike launched by the Saudi Arabia-led coalition on a temporary prison in Yemen has killed at least 77 people. "More than 77 killed prisoners and nearly 146 wounded have been transported by ambulances to the hospitals of Saada so far," according to a statement released by the Houthi-controlled Ministry of Health.
