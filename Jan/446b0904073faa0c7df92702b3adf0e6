Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday said he hoped that foreign experts can give more suggestions to the Chinese government and help promote exchanges and cooperation between China and the world. Li made the remarks at a symposium with representatives of those working in China before the Spring Festival, or the Chinese New Year, which falls on February 1 this year. Experts from countries including Britain and South Africa shared their advice and suggestions. Li extended greetings to the foreign experts and thanked them for their contributions to China's reform, opening-up and modernization. Li said China made significant achievements in social and economic development in the past year despite severe internal and external challenges and risks. The country has prioritized employment in its macro policy and revitalized market entities through tax and fee cuts, said Li. "We have implemented policies in proper intensity, leaving policy space for this year to address challenges." In the face of new downward economic pressure, Li stressed that the country would strengthen cross-cyclical adjustments to keep the country's economy running within an appropriate range. China will strengthen targeted adjustments, take timely and effective measures to cope with challenges, stabilize market expectations, and boost market confidence, he said. The premier added that China will take bolder measures to alleviate difficulties faced by enterprises, including implementing tax and fee cuts, lowering financing costs of micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises, and expanding effective demands. Stressing that opening-up is a fundamental state policy, Li said China would continue pushing forward a high-level opening-up and provide more convenience for foreign experts to work and live in China.
