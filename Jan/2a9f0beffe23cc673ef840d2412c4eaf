The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Sunday held a national flag-raising ceremony at the Central Military Dock for the first time to welcome the Chinese New Year, which falls on February 1. The garrison's honor guard marched to the dock in neat steps from the Central Barracks early in the morning. The flag-raising ceremony fully demonstrated the garrison's confidence and determination to safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests and maintain Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability.
