The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) conducted tests of an upgraded long-range cruise missile and a warhead of a tactical guided missile this week, state media outlet Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said on Friday. An update to a long-range cruise missile system was tested on Tuesday, and another test was held to confirm the power of a conventional warhead for a surface-to-surface tactical guided missile on Thursday, KCNA said. These tests were conducted by the Academy of Defense Science, it added. In the test-fire for updating the long-range cruise missile system on Tuesday local time, two long-range cruise missiles flew along the flight trajectory over the East Sea of Korea to hit the target island, according to KCNA. In the test-fire for confirming the power of conventional warhead for the surface-to-surface tactical guided missile on Thursday local time, "two tactical guided missiles precisely hit the target island." DPRK's leader Kim Jong Un visited a munitions factory producing a "major weapon system," according to a separate report by KCNA. Kim lauded the factory for achieving progress in "producing major weapons" and holding a "very important position and duty" in modernizing the country's armed forces and realizing its national defense development strategy.
