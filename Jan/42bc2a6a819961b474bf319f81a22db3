Argentina on Monday reaffirmed its "legitimate sovereignty rights" over the Islas Malvinas, also known as the Falkland Islands. On the 189th anniversary of the islands falling into British hands, Argentina's Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a statement asserting that the Islas Malvinas were "illegally occupied" on January 3, 1833, by British forces that "evicted the Argentine authorities legitimately established there."
