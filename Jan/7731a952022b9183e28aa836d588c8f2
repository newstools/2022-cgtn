The official manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) has beaten expectations and remains in expansion at 50.1 in January, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Sunday. While it remains in expansion, the country's manufacturing PMI slightly dropped from 50.3 last December, according to NBS. A reading above 50 indicates expansion in activities, while a reading below that mark reflects contraction. The figure was slightly above Reuter's estimate, which had predicted a fall to the 50-point mark. The country's factory activity had unexpectedly rebounded to expansion in November last year after seven months of decline. This is the third straight month for the factory activity remaining in expansion territory. The official non-manufacturing PMI, which measures activities in the construction and service sectors, dropped 1.6 percentage points from the previous month to 51.1 and remains in expansion. The official composite PMI, which includes both manufacturing and services activities, stood at 51.0, dropping 1.2 percentage points from last month, NBS data showed.
