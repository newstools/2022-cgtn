New studies from six research groups indicate that the Omicron variant is more likely to infect the throat than the lungs. Scientists said that may explain why the new variant appears to be more contagious but less deadly than other previous variants. The studies on mice and hamsters found that Omicron does not damage people's lungs as much as the Delta and other variants. The studies have yet to be peer-reviewed by other scientists.
