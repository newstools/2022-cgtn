The U.S. "unreasonable" suspended 44 Chinese passenger flights by four Chinese carriers from America to China, disrupted the normal operation of Chinese airlines and disregarded the health and safety of Chinese and foreign passengers, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Monday. All international flights coming into China have "been applied the same control measure to airlines, Chinese or foreign, in a fair, open and transparent way," Zhao said. China urges the U.S. to stop politicizing flight epidemic prevention, disrupting and restricting normal personnel exchanges between the two countries, said Zhao.
