Two Canadian tourists were shot dead after an unidentified gunman opened fire at Hotel Xcaret in Playa del Carmen in Mexico's Quintana Roo, local media reported on Friday. Another Canadian tourist was also shot and was sent to the hospital with injury. Quintana Roo state prosecutor's office said the suspect in the shooting was apparently a guest and Canadian police informed them he was a known felon with a long record related to robbery, drug and weapon offenses. The office said both of the dead also had criminal records. Meanwhile, local authorities said they were searching for the suspect. The Xcaret resort is south of Playa del Carmen, one of Mexico's top tourist destinations.
