This is the first time that the CGTN Nature crew has received an interview, reviewed the past year's journey and shared the most fascinating, worrying and moving moments. Although filming a nature documentary is relatively complex than other programs, the crew has to capture the shots in an uncontrollable environment and, at the same time, protect all its members from unexpected events. In this Spring Festival specialty, we unveil some of the unknown behind-the-scenes stories from the crew members who were still filming outside and asked them about their new year wishes. Check the video to learn more. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
