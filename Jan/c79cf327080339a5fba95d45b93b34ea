The third rehearsal of China Media Group's (CMG) 2022 Spring Festival Gala was held on Tuesday. This year's gala pays more attention to details, and features programs that will mesmerize viewers. The rehearsal was smoother than the first two, with a better overall atmosphere and a more natural transition between programs. This year's Spring Festival Gala strives to create a happy, festive environment featuring traditional reunions during the country's biggest holiday. The program is designed to resonate with audiences on an emotional level, with scenes depicting cultural heritage, themes of the times, rural revitalization and the Winter Olympics, among others. Performers include artists from the national art troupe and the grassroots levels. Their passionate performances will showcase the strong culture of chasing, building and realizing dreams. The 2022 Spring Festival Gala will continue to be refined and further enriched in content and form, dedicating a cultural feast full of artistry, enthusiasm and joy for Chinese people around the world. The event will air at 8 p.m. Beijing Time on Chinese New Year's Eve (January 31).
