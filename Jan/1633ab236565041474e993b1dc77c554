Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow and Los Angeles Rams quarterback Matthew Stafford are meeting each other in their Super Bowl debuts at SoFi Stadium on February 13. Burrow led the underdog Bengals to upset Patrick Mahomes and the Kansas City Chiefs to win their first American Football Conference title since 1989. Stafford and the Rams beat the impregnable defense of the San Francisco 49ers to become the second team in NFL history to play a Super Bowl at home. One thing is for sure, either Burrow or Stafford will make history when he wins Super Bowl LVI.
