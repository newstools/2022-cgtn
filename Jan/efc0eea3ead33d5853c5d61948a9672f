On January 5, 2022, in the Shanwangping Nature Reserve located in Nanchuan District of southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, golden pheasants, which are under second-class state protection nationally, were spotted foraging in snow. The golden pheasant is endemic to China. It is famous for its vivid feathers and long tail and is considered a prototype of the mythical phoenix.
