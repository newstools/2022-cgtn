An airstrike in Ethiopia's northern region of Tigray killed 56 people and wounded at least 30, two aid workers told Reuters on Saturday, citing local authorities and eyewitness accounts. The strike hit a camp for displaced people in the town of Dedebit in the northwest of the region, near the border with Eritrea, the aid workers said. The aid workers, who asked not to be named, said the number of dead has been confirmed by the local authorities.
