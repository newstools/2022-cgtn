Tennis superstar Novak Djokovic's legal battle to stay in Australia and chase a record 21st Grand Slam opened Monday, but online access to media was delayed by a computer glitch, a court spokesperson said. "I am now advised the hearing has started. The court is working to rectify the situation. Apologies," said federal court spokesperson Bruce Phillips.
