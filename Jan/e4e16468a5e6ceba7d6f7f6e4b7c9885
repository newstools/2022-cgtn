An AFP tally shows that Europe has recorded over 100 million COVID-19 cases to date. That is more than a third of total infections around the world. Europe has reported nearly 5 million cases over the past week alone, with the highly transmissible Omicron variant leading several countries to report record numbers of daily cases in successive days. France, the hardest hit, reported nearly 220,000 new cases on Saturday, a fourth day of more than 200,000. The UK logged more than 160,000 new infections, bringing its total number to more than 13 million.
