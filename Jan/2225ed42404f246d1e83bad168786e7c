At least 15 people have died in separate attacks by armed groups in DR Congo's troubled northeastern province of Ituri, local sources and monitors said on Monday. A militia group called the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo (CODECO) ransacked the village of Mabanga in Djugu territory on Sunday, "killing six people, including four women," Ngandjole Assani, a representative of local grassroots groups, told AFP. In Irumu territory farther south, members of CODECO and a group called the Patriotic and Integrationist Force of the Congo (FPIC) attacked the village of Kokonyangi on the same day, a local chief said. "Eleven bodies were found and 10 other civilians were injured," said Jonas Lemi Zorabo, a traditional leader in the Babao-Bokoe area. A U.S.-headquartered monitoring group, the Kivu Security Tracker, said nine people died in Kokonyangi.
