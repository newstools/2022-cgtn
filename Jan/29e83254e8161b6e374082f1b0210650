Here is CGTN's series report of "the Game Makers." In this series, we profile a group of people who make tremendous contributions to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games or show their great passion for winter sports. In the 11th episode, we tell the story of Zhang Yibing, a snowboarding fan involved in the sport for the first time at the age of 40. He says that his job in the future is to introduce winter sports to more people.
