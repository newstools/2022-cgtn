Photos and videos showing piles of empty boxes littered alongside rail tracks in Los Angeles County, California, have gone viral as shipping companies say they've seen a dramatic spike in railroad theft. Union Pacific, one of the U.S.' largest railroad company, says it may avoid operating in Los Angeles County following the spike in theft. The containers and trains are locked, but can be broken into.
