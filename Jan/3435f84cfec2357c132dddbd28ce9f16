Dog sleds have been used for centuries as tools for hunting and transportation on ice. Over time, they have also evolved for use as a popular form of winter sport and entertainment. La Grande Odyssée Savoie Mont Blanc is one of the biggest and most iconic events in Europe each year. It attracts the best sled drivers, known as "mushers," and hundreds of amazing dogs from all over the world to participate. Cindy Duport has already competed in five installments and won several titles. This year, she'll be on the hunt yet again for the final podium prize with her buddy Nucky, a Scandinavian hound.
