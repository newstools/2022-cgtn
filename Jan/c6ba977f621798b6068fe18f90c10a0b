Nine-year-old Ji Yi, or Mocha, has been playing ice hockey since she was 3 years old. Corner Smith, her coach for the last six years, said that the best thing about her is her ice hockey spirit. "She never has a bad day, she's always happy, she's always smiling when she's on the ice. That's what I really enjoy about coaching her," Smith told us. "I think that if children can find passion in something they like at such a young age, they can overcome all kinds of difficulties to keep doing it. I think that's not easy," said Ji's mom, Tian Tian. CGTN followed Ji for a day to find out how ice hockey has changed her and how she has thrived in this male-dominated game.
