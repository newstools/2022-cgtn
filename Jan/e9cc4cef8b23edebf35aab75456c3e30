Honda Motor and its Chinese joint venture partner Dongfeng Motor said on Thursday they would build a new factory in central China's Wuhan to exclusively manufacture electric vehicles (EVs) from 2024. The factory would have a production capacity of 120,000 vehicles a year, Honda said in a statement.
