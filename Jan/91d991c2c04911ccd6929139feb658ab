Songpan County of the Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture on the plateau in the western part of southwest China's Sichuan Province welcomed its first snow of 2022 on January 13. As the Spring Festival, which falls on February 1, arrives soon, the ancient town in Songpan is decorated with red lanterns and couplets. Red decorations against white snow create a beautiful festival scene. (Cover image is a screenshot. Video provided by Zhang Chengliang and Zhou Kerun.)
