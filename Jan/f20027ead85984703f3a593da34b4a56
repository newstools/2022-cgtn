U.S. President Joe Biden marked one year in the White House. How has the country changed during his presidency? And with challenges from the pandemic and inflation, and repairing the relationship with allies: can Biden deliver on his campaign promise to reset the United States? A massive volcanic eruption in Tonga triggered a tsunami, causing significant damage to the country. Scientists say the eruption was likely the biggest recorded on earth in more than 30 years. Relief efforts are underway but face the challenge of severed communications, falling ash closing the major airport and strict anti-COVID measures. For this edition of Dialogue Weekend show, we have Einar Tangen, independent current affairs commentator; Dr. Zhao Hai, research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences; Dr. Shawn Wei, endowed assistant professor of geological sciences at Michigan State University; and Wu Changhua, executive director of the Professional Association for China's Environment.
