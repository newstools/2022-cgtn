An indigenous community in the western Canadian province of British Columbia has found 93 "potential human burial" sites after a survey of the land surrounding a former residential school, CBC News reported on Tuesday. Williams Lake First Nation (WLFN) community said the sites were identified during their investigation into St. Joseph's Mission Residential School and nearby Onward Ranch, the report added. The discovery was a part of a "reawakening" of the lingering traumas of the residential school system for the indigenous community, WLFN Chief Willie Sellars was quoted as saying.
