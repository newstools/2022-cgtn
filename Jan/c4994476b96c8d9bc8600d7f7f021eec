The Chinese Embassy in the UK, on Saturday, expressed strong opposition and protest against a joint statement from the Australia-UK ministerial meeting, calling its content regarding China a gross interference in internal affairs, and is in violation of international law and the basic norms governing international relations. Issued following the annual Australia-United Kingdom Ministerial Consultations (AUKMIN) meeting held in Sydney on Friday, the statement said the countries expressed concerns over so-called human rights violations in China's Xinjiang, situation in Hong Kong, Taiwan as well as the South China Sea. "Taiwan-, Xinjiang- and Hong Kong-related affairs are purely China's internal affairs, and no foreign country has the right to interfere," a spokesperson of the Chinese embassy said in a statement. "No foreign country should underestimate the strong determination, firm will and strong ability of the Chinese people to defend the country's territorial sovereignty."
