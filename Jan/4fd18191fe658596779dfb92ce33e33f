A fire that has raged at South Africa's parliament building for two days was finally contained on Tuesday, reported AFP citing firefighters. The parliament fire, which started early Sunday, was initially declared under control on Monday. However, strong winds reignited flames, leaving dozens of firefighters once again battling late into the night. "Firefighters managed to contain the fire just before 12:00 last night," spokesman Jermaine Carelse said. The cause of the fire is still unknown. One person has been arrested in connection with the fire.
