The Saudi-led coalition in Yemen launched multiple airstrikes on a military camp controlled by the Houthi militia in the Yemeni capital on Tuesday, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported. It was the second consecutive day of airstrikes by the coalition that hit the al-Siyanah maintenance camp in central Sanaa, al-Masirah said without providing further details. The explosions smashed windows of nearby houses and sent a fire which could be seen from downtown. The airstrikes came after the militia claimed responsibility for explosive-laden drones and ballistic missile attacks on sites in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on Monday morning.
