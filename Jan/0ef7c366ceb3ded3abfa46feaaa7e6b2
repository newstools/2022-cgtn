Torrential rains in Brazil's Sao Paulo state between Friday and Sunday left at least 19 people dead, authorities said. Among the people who died from the storms this weekend were seven children, while about 500 families had to flee their homes, according to the local fire department. Governor Joao Doria announced he was releasing 15 million reales ($2.7 million) to help the 10 most affected cities and 645 municipalities in Brazil's most populous state -- home to 46 million people.
