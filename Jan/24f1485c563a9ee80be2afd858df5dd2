The final day of the Portuguese election campaign was on January 28, and people will cast their votes to form a new government on Sunday. There was a euphoric atmosphere at a rally held by Portugal's governing Socialist Party, or PS as it's known. The government of Prime Minister Antonio Costa, in power since 2015, is looking to win a third consecutive term.
