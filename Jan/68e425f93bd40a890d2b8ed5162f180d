An explosion and fire, apparently triggered by a gas leak, demolished several row house apartment units in New York City's Bronx borough on Tuesday, killing one resident and injuring at least eight other people, authorities said. Five of those injured were police officers who rushed into the burning structure to rescue residents trapped inside, officials said.
