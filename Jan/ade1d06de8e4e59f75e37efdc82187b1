Russian Foreign Ministry Tuesday strongly condemned Kosovo's expulsion of a Russian diplomat and member of the United Nations mission in the Balkan country, saying it is a provocation and an attempt to squeeze the UN mission out of Kosovo, according to a press release by the ministry. Kosovo on December 31 declared the Russian employee of the UN Mission persona non grata (person not welcome).
