Zhongshan City in south China's Guangdong Province lies on the alluvial plains of the Pearl River Delta. Its intertwined river networks offer optimal conditions for swamp cypress trees to grow. The tree's lacy needles look like red feathers during autumn and winter, and the coastal and riverside area of the city are dyed red if you look at it from the sky. The arbor is native to the southeastern United States and prefers a humid climate. It was introduced to cities in south China because it has a high resistance to typhoons and adapts well to different conditions.
