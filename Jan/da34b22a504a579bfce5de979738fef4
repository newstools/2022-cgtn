Over 1.22 billion people have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 on the Chinese mainland as of Friday, health authorities said on Saturday at a press conference. China is now facing a challenge from both Delta and Omicron variants as the country's annual Spring Festival travel rush approaches, Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission (NHC), told the press conference. COVID-19 resurgence has been found in several Chinese cities, including Tianjin and Xi'an. Prevention and control work has entered the final stage in Xi'an while the risk of virus spread in Tianjin is declining as most recent cases were detected among people in group quarantine, Mi added.
