The North Macedonia's parliament on Sunday elected Dimitar Kovacevski, the president of the Social Democractic Union of Macedonia (SDSM), as the country's new prime minister. Kovacevski was appointed as deputy minister of finance, a position he still holds, by the previous government. He has been widely expected to be next prime minister since Zoran Zaev resigned after a defeat in 2021 local elections.
