CGTN's Winter Olympics-themed production "One Dream" will be broadcast on January 22. "One Dream", a 60-minute feature accompanied by a series of short videos, follows six young aspiring athletes – figure skaters, hockey players and speed skaters – from China and Canada, as they learn about each other's culture and lifestyle and discover they are united by the shared goal of one day competing together on the global stage. Here is the second set of posters for "One Dream", featuring the six teenagers who will tell you about the winter sports that they hope will carry them to their shared dream.
