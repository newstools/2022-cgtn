At least 11 migrants drowned in a shipwreck off Tunisia as they tried to cross the Mediterranean to Europe, while 21 others were rescued by the coastguard, Reuters reported on Friday, citing an army spokesman. He added the coastguard had recovered five bodies, while the search was still under way for six more drowned.
