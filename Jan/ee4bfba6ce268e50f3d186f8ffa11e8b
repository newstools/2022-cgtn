The joint statement issued on Monday by China, France, Russia, Britain and the United States on nuclear weapons demonstrated the political will to prevent nuclear war and maintain global strategic peace and stability, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday. "China hopes that the five countries will enhance mutual trust, strengthen coordination, and play a positive role in building a world with lasting peace and common security," Wang added. "China has always maintained a nuclear strategy that is defensive, pursued a policy of no-first-use of nuclear weapons, and maintained its nuclear force at the minimum level required for safeguarding national security," Wang said, adding that China "will continue to contribute efforts to global nuclear governance."
