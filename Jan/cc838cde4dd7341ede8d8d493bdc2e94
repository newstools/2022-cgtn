Infrared cameras in Wuzhifeng Nature Reserve in Ganzhou City, east China's Jiangxi Province recently captured sambar deer, Chinese muntjac and other wildlife. Rare footage of two Chinese muntjacs frolicking was recorded. There are mainly three types of muntjacs living in China, and the Chinese muntjac has the smallest size and is native to China. In the video, a sambar deer with a weight of about 100 kilograms was foraging at night. It has a larger size compared to the Chinese muntjac. The species is under second-class state protection. With a forest coverage rate of 98 percent, Wuzhifeng Provincial Nature Reserve is home to over 150 types of wild animals. (Cover image via screenshot.)
