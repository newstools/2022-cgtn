Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday, the Federal Chancellery said, adding that he was infected by a member of his security team. Nehammer, 49, shows no symptoms and carries out his official duties from home via video and telephone meetings. He will not attend in-person meetings in the next few days. "There is no need to worry, I am fine," Nehammer was quoted by the Chancellery as saying. "My appeal continues to be: Go get vaccinated, get a booster, that will protect you with high probability against serious illness." Nehammer has been vaccinated three times. His wife and children tested negative on Friday. (With input from Xinhua)
