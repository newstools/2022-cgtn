China advised the concerned countries to do more in the interest of regional peace and stability, rather than flexing muscles, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday, when responding to a query about the crashed U.S. F-35C fighter jet. China has no intention of retrieving the stealth fighter which crashes on the U.S. aircraft carrier in the South China Sea, Zhao said at the briefing.
