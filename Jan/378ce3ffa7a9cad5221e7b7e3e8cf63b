Freestyle skier Nico Porteous made history at age 16 when he became New Zealand's youngest Olympic medalist by winning bronze at PyeongChang 2018. He went on to another world-first at this year's Aspen X Games, claiming the title after landing back-to-back 1620s in the halfpipe. Now 20 years old, he's looking forward to Beijing to make history again.
