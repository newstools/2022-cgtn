Colorful steamed buns featuring Spring Festival themes are popular at a bakery in east China's Shandong Province. Steamed buns are a traditional snack made from soft dough and filled with ingredients like sweet red bean or lotus seed paste, pork, meat or vegetables, and are steam cooked. The 2022 Lunar New Year will usher in the Year of the Tiger on the Chinese zodiac calendar, so buns with that theme are especially popular as the February 1 holiday nears.
