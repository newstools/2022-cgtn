Taiwan-funded enterprises on the Chinese mainland can fully enjoy the preferential rules of origin and tariff under the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a Chinese mainland spokesperson said on Wednesday. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, made the remarks when responding to a question on how the RCEP agreement would benefit Taiwan-funded enterprises on the mainland. The RCEP, the world's largest free trade agreement, entered into force on the first day of 2022 for six ASEAN members – Brunei, Cambodia, Laos, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam – and four non-ASEAN signatory states – China, Japan, New Zealand and Australia. According to the RCEP agreement, more than 90 percent of merchandise trade among members will eventually be subject to zero tariffs.

According to the island's finance authority, the Taiwan region's exports to the Chinese mainland and Hong Kong Special Administrative Region totaled a record high of $188.91 billion in 2021, accounted for 42.3 percent of its total exports in 2021. Data showed that the Taiwan region's economic growth depends on cross-strait economic and trade cooperation and it would be unwise and futile to attempt to interfere and hinder such cooperation for political self-interest, Zhu added.
