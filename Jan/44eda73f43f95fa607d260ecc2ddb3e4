Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday formally launched the country's first national security policy, which he said was a "major priority" of his government. The policy articulated that Pakistan's security rests on its citizens, and stressed the necessity to promote "delivery-based good governance". The document was endorsed by the prime minister's cabinet last week.
