The six NFL wild-card games played last weekend produced few surprises. Super Bowl favorites like the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Kansas City Chiefs both secured easy wins; the rising Cincinnati Bengals and Buffalo Bills defeated their opponents too; the Los Angeles Rams, who were relatively disappointing in their last few games, refused to be upset by the Arizona Cardinals. By contrast, the Dallas Cowboys embarrassed themselves the most, not only with the loss to the San Francisco 49ers, but also due to how they lost it. Someone – Dak Prescott, coach Mike McCarthy, offensive coordinator Kellen Moore or another staff member – will have to be held responsible for the loss and their last offensive call. The divisional round will start on Saturday. The Tennessee Titans and Green Bay Packers, both of which had a first-round bye, will host the young Bengals and the resilient 49ers, respectively. Meanwhile, the Bills want vengeance from the Chiefs after last year's American Football Conference (AFC) Championship Game. The Rams will try to stop Tom Brady from winning his eighth Vince Lombardi Trophy. Host: Li Xiang Guest: Matthew Watson Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
