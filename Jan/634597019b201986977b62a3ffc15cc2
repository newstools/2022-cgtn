Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered an online keynote speech at the five-day Davos Agenda Virtual Event. Since his debut in 2017, President Xi has delivered 3 keynote speeches offering Chinese wisdom on how to view, understand and participate in the global economy. Despite the ongoing pandemic and disruption in the global supply chain, China's GDP expanded by 8.1 percent in 2021, beating expectations and setting a new record for the decade. What were the highlights of President Xi's speech? And how to evaluate China's economic performance in 2021? To address these issues and more, we've invited He Weiwen, senior fellow at the Center for China and Globalization; Andy Mok, technology analyst and current affairs commentator; and Michele Geraci, former Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economic Development in Italy.
