The inauguration ceremony for the Eurasian Research Institute of Renmin University of China (RUC) and the first Belt and Road and Eurasian Development Forum were held on Tuesday in Beijing. Liu Wei, president of RUC, said the establishment of the institute will inject new momentum into building an interdisciplinary academic research and exchange platform and deepening exchanges and cooperation among countries along the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). "The new established institute will carry out in-depth research on topics such as regional and country studies, global governance, economic development, social governance, public diplomacy and the BRI, and it will make new and greater contributions to promoting the building of a community with a shared future for humanity." Congratulatory messages from overseas guests, such as Filip Vujanovic, former president of Montenegro, David Sandalow, an inaugural fellow at the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University, Brice Lalonde, former French minister for the environment and chair of the Business and Climate Summit, were sent to mark the establishment of the institute. Eurasian affairs are the key to determining the future of Europe, Asia and human civilization, they said, adding that the establishment of the institute is visionary and provides a good platform for joint cooperation for the world, and will contribute to further strengthening the connection between Asia and Europe.
