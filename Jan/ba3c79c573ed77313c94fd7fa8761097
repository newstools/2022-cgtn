Ice and snow help create majestic winter scenery in the Jiuzhaigou Valley in southwest China's Sichuan Province. In the scenic spot, most of the lakes' water is supplied by underground springs and thus doesn't freeze even in temperatures under minus 10 degrees Celsius. Well known for its spectacular waterfalls, lush forests, serene plateau lakes and karst rock formations, the Jiuzhaigou Valley rises from about 2,000 meters to 4,500 meters above sea level. It was inscribed as a world heritage site by UNESCO in 1992. (Cover image via CFP.) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
