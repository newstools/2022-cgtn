A research team from northeast China's Dalian University of Technology independently developed a high-performance ski helmet with aerospace technology. This helmet, which uses the shell manufacturing technology of the Long March-5 carrier rocket, weighs only about 700 grams. Its use of thin-walled aerospace technology has greatly improved its anti-deformation capability. The helmet has passed European ski helmet safety standard tests. Check out the video for more.
