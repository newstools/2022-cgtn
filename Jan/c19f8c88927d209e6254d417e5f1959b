A fresh oil leak has occurred off the coast of Peru - already cleaning up after a major crude spill 10 days earlier - during work on an underwater refinery pipeline, the government said Wednesday. The leak occurred Tuesday during work at a refinery of Spanish company Repsol. A tanker was unloading at the same refinery when it spilled 6,000 barrels of crude into the ocean on January 15 after it was hit by waves triggered by a volcanic eruption near Tonga, the environment ministry said.
