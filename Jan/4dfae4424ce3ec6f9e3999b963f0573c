The Los Angeles Lakers won their second consecutive game on Sunday after 37-year-old LeBron James played center for 68 minutes in two games. With DeAndre Jordan and Dwight Howard on the roster, few would have expected to see James playing the center position. Sadly, even fewer would expect James score 30+ points in seven consecutive games, resulting in five losses. Trying to figure out one or several game-changing trades would be the first thought for teams trapped in a similar situation. The Lakers have already put the wheels in motion, sending Rajon Rondo to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Denzel Valentine, who will most likely be waived to free up a roster spot. The bigger problem is, can the Lakers make more and bigger trades to fix their problem? Host: Li Xiang Guest: Matthew Watson Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
