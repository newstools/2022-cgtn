Team China's podium uniform for the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics, also known as Champion Dragon Clothes, was unveiled on Friday. The uniform, inspired by traditional Chinese culture and the Chinese character "Zhong," features a stand collar and knot button. The red line in the middle stands for the central axis of Chinese capital city Beijing, which means the host city will draw together international friends, echoing the official motto of the Winter Olympics "Together for a shared future." Renowned Hong Kong designer Timmy Yip is the mastermind behind the uniform. He also deigned Team China's podium uniform at Tokyo 2020. He said the uniform, as a window to showcase Chinese culture, features simple yet cheerful characteristics. "The stand collar and knot button is distinctive and simple. The red lines on the two sides, together with the line in the middle form the Chinese character 'Zhong', giving people a mobile sense of climbing up," Yip said. "I hope the design can inspire the athletes and make them proud to fight for the country at the Games," he added. High technology is also applied to keep the outfit light, warm and structured for the indoor events. For snow sports held in lower temperatures in the open air, double-layered cotton material is used and the clothing is water resistant and windproof.
