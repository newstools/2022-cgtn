China's Zhao Xintong was crowned at the German Masters on Sunday, winning against compatriot Yan Bingtao 9-0 in an all-Chinese final. Zhao, 24, continued the momentum of his breakout season in Berlin following his win at the UK Championship in December 2021. He now ranks eighth in the world. Zhao wrapped up the afternoon session with wins in all eight frames. Yan, 22, had chances in the first frame of the evening session but was unable to convert them. Instead, Zhao sealed the deal in the first frame in the evening and became the third player to win a two-session ranking event without conceding a frame. Zhao also became the second Chinese player to win at this event, following Ding Junhui's victory in 2014. "I had no idea the game could go this smooth. He is a very strong opponent, also a good friend. Even though he lost today, the final is a good thing for snooker in China in general," Zhao said after the competition. (With input from Xinhua)
