A military court in the Democratic Republic of Congo sentenced 51 people to death on Saturday, several in absentia, in a mass trial related to the 2017 murder of two UN experts in a troubled central region. Capital punishment is frequently pronounced in murder cases in the DRC but is routinely commuted to life imprisonment since the country declared a moratorium on executions in 2003.
