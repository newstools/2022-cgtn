A new cold war between China and the U.S. is "not an attractive model," former secretary of U.S. Treasury Lawrence Summers told CGTN in a live video discussion broadcast on Thursday. He made the comments when talking about the recent China-U.S. relations at CGTN's "China-U.S. Econtalk" with host Guan Xin and founder of Primavera Capital Fred Hu.

But he still insisted that the two countries have a lot in common to keep the cooperation going. "They share a common world. They share a common planet in terms of the issue of climate change," he said. "They share a common interest in a world that is stable, and a world that is generally prospering." He also said that the U.S. should not try to stop China from rising, and China should not seek to displace the U.S. from its global influence. Hu said he shares the same worries with Summers on the current China-U.S. tension and asked the two countries to "just sit down and talk." "U.S. controls 70 percent of semiconductors and 90 percent of software that Chinese companies use," he said. "China is responsible of more than 50 percent of IT gadgets and supply chain, 70 percent of EV batteries." He added that the U.S. actions to restrict Chinese tech companies will make itself "a completely unreliable partner" and would lead to China's "sputnik moment" in which the country is left with no choices but to develop its own cutting-edge technologies. Summers, from the other way round, argued that China should not see all U.S. actions as protectionist, and China should admit the fact there are some companies in the country conducting "rather problematic practices." The two guests agreed that there are still much room for China and the U.S. to seek cooperation.
