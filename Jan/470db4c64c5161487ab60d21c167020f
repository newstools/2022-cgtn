Liuhuang Valley in Qilian Mountains National Park is right at the epicenter of the magnitude-6.9 earthquake that took place in Menyuan Hui Autonomous County in northwest China's Qinghai Province on January 8. Despite the cracks on the land and the frozen river surface, nature still greets us with its splendid snowy mountains and wildlife. A group of blue sheep came down the hillside to graze and find water. Some of them lied down to rest after a hearty meal. The blue sheep is under first-class state protection in China and is a major prey for the snow leopard. Whenever you see them hanging around, it's highly possible that you will see a snow leopard lurking around as well.
