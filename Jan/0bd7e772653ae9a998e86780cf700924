The Yellow River in northern China has frozen due to low winter temperatures, and smaller streams have formed beautiful patterns like veins and arteries over the vast land. The Yellow River is known as "Mother River" in Chinese culture, nurturing life and history in the north. Once threatened by drought and pollution, efforts are underway to try and restore it and its ecological system, including through a new draft law on the protection of the Yellow River. The draft law proposes measures such as a fishing ban in key waters of the river basin and the establishment of nature reserve areas. CGTN Nature presents a documentary series on the Yellow River, and the ecological, cultural environment based on the second longest river in China.
