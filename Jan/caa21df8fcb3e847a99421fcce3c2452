Iran is expected to regain its vote in the UN General Assembly after South Korea paid Tehran's delinquent dues to the world body with Iranian funds frozen within that country, South Korean officials said on Sunday. Iran had regained its UN voting rights in June after a similar payment but said this month that it had lost them again because it could not transfer the necessary dues as a result of U.S. sanctions.
