China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN) said on Thursday that it had put an offshore wind farm into full operation off the coast of southeast China's Fujian Province. The wind-power project, located northeast of Dalian Island in Pingtan County, was connected to the nationwide power grid at full capacity on Wednesday night, the Shenzhen-headquartered company said. The project, with 60 turbines, has a total installed power generation capacity of 240 MW. It is expected to send about 960 million kWh of electricity to the power grid annually, saving 308,100 tonnes of standard coal and reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 900,000 tonnes a year. CGN, China's largest nuclear power operator, has invested heavily in offshore wind power facilities, building 2,358 MW of plants in the country.
