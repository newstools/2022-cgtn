At least eight people died in a stampede on Monday outside a stadium in Cameroon that was hosting a soccer match in the African Cup of Nations. The tragedy occurred as crowds struggled to access Olembe Stadium in the capital city of Yaoundé to watch the host country play Comoros in a last-16 knockout game.
