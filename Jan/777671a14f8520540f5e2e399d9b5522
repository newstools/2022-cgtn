Canadian Foreign Minister Melanie Joly will visit Kiev next week to reaffirm support for Ukrainian sovereignty and reinforce efforts to deter "aggressive actions" by Russia, Ottawa said on Saturday. Joly will meet Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal and Deputy Prime Minister Olga Stefanishyna, and travel to the west of the country to speak to a 200 strong Canadian training mission that has been there since 2015. The visit is part of a week-long trip that will also include stops in Paris and Brussels. Russia has repeatedly accused the West of threatening its security by expanding NATO eastwards and deploying weapons systems near its borders. (With input from Reuters)
