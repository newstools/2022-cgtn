Central China's Henan Province has been fighting a new COVID-19 outbreak since the end of December 2021. Six temporary inflatable labs have been built recently in provincial capital Zhengzhou for over 10 million city dwellers who are required to undergo several rounds of nucleic acid testing. The labs can process 100,000 samples per day. CGTN's Huang Yichang has more from the site.
