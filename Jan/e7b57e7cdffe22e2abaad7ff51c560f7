All million-kilowatt hydro-generating units of the Baihetan hydropower station in southwest China have started pre-operation countdown after its last generating rotor was installed on Tuesday. Baihetan will be the world's second-largest hydropower station in terms of total installed capacity, next only to the Three Gorges Dam project in central China's Hubei Province. All units of the hydropower station are scheduled to be operational in July 2022 and will generate an average of more than 62.4 billion kWh of electricity every year.
