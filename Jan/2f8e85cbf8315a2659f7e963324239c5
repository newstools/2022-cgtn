Belgian police fired tear gas and water cannon at protesters marching against COVID-19 restrictions in central Brussels on Sunday. Protesters had thrown wood at police and damaged buildings. Prime Minister Alexandre De Croo on Friday announced that people will need booster shots after five months to maintain COVID-19 passes that give access to bars or cinemas.
