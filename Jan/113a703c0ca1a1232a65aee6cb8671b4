U.S. infectious disease expert and White House chief medical advisor Doctor Anthony Fauci on Tuesday warned that just about everybody in the country will be exposed to the Omicron variant of the coronavirus. "Omicron, with its extraordinary, unprecedented degree of efficiency of transmissibility, will, ultimately, find just about everybody," Fauci told the Center for Strategic and International Studies in a "fireside chat." "Those who have been vaccinated and vaccinated and boosted would get exposed. Some, maybe a lot of them, will get infected but will very likely, with some exceptions, do reasonably well in the sense of not having hospitalization and death," he said.
