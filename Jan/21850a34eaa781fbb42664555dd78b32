Nigerian security forces have rescued nearly 100 kidnap victims held in forest hideouts in the country's northwest after they were kidnapped at least two months ago by criminal gangs, police said on Tuesday. Nigeria's police and army have been cracking down in recent months on heavily-armed groups known locally as bandits who target villages and communities mostly in central and northwestern states for looting raids and mass abductions for ransom.
