Twenty-three people were killed in Colombia's Arauca province amid fighting between illegal armed groups, said Defense Minister Diego Molano at a news conference late on Monday. Fighting broke out over the weekend in Arauca as members of the National Liberation Army (ELN) fought with dissident elements of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) who rejected a 2016 peace deal, according to Reuters.
