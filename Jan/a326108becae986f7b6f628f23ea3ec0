Thousands joined a government-sponsored rally in Mali's capital Bamako, on Friday, to protest new regional economic sanctions and growing pressure from former colonizer France, after Mali's military ruler pushed back promised elections by four years. Friday's demonstration at Bamako's Independence Square drew Mali's prime minister and other ministers in the transitional government, headed by Col. Assimi Goita, who installed himself as president following a second military coup last year.
