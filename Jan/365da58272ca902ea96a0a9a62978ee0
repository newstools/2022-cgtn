Pediatric hospitalizations related to COVID-19 in the U.S. are at the highest level since the start of the pandemic, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The country is averaging 893 new hospital admissions each day for children 17 years and under, a record high since the CDC started to track the number from August 2020. Most of these hospitalizations are related to COVID-19, although some were admitted for other causes but tested positive for COVID-19 when hospitalized or during their hospital stay, according to the CDC. The country saw over 90,000 total hospital admissions for children 17 years and under from August 1, 2020 to January 13, 2022, CDC data showed. The highest hospitalization rates among children are in those under the age of 4, who are not yet eligible for vaccination. The Omicron variant does not appear to cause more severe disease in children than other coronavirus variants, and the overall rates of pediatric hospitalizations are still lower than in any adult age group, according to the CDC. The CDC expected that COVID-19 children hospitalizations would continue to increase in the coming weeks. The CDC urged everyone aged 5 years and older to get a COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against COVID-19.
