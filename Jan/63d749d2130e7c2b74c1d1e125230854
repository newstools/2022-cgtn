Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev on Friday vowed to destroy the rioters within the shortest time. Up to 20,000 "bandits" had attacked the financial capital Almaty and were destroying state property, Tokayev said in a televised address. "Terrorists continue to damage property... and use weapons against civilians. I have given the order to law enforcement to shoot to kill without warning," Tokayev said in his third televised address to the nation this week. Making the comments in a speech, the president thanked China and other countries as well as international organizations for their support to the Kazakh government. On the same day, during a regular press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said China will do its best to provide support to Kazakhstan and help the country tide over the difficulties. On Friday morning, security forces appeared to be in control of the streets of Kazakhstan's main city Almaty and the president said constitutional order had mostly been restored.
