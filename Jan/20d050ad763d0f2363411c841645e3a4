China is willing to continue to open the door to more Philippine agricultural products and improve investment to help the Philippines accelerate its industrialization and modernization process and enhance its independent development capabilities, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday. He made the remarks when addressing the Manila Forum for China-Philippines Relations via video. China and the Philippines should maintain their friendship, remove disruptions, deepen cooperation, and jointly open up a better future for bilateral relations, he said. Noting that the friendly exchanges between the two countries have lasted for over 1,000 years, he said China will continue to guarantee Philippine COVID-19 vaccine needs. On the South China Sea issue, he said China is prepared to promote joint development without affecting each other's respective rights and claims. The foreign minister also called on both sides to maintain the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-centered regional cooperation framework and deepen the China-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership.
