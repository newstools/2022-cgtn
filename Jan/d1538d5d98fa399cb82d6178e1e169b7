China's new energy passenger car sales last year jumped by 169.1 percent compared to 2020, reaching a total number of 2.99 million units sold, industry data showed on Tuesday. In December alone, retail sales of new energy passenger vehicles stood at 475,000, up 128.8 percent year on year, according to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). The total sales of passenger cars in the country rose 4.4 percent year on year to 20.15 million units, the CPCA revealed. Although the decline of subsidies for new energy vehicle purchases may affect consumer sentiment, sales of green cars will see limited impact as a pre-delivery order backlog remains, the CPCA predicted.
