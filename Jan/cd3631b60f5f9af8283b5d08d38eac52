Four residents in northwest Nigeria told AFP on Saturday that gunmen known locally as "bandits" killed at least 140 people in multiple raids this week not yet confirmed by the authorities. "We buried a total of 143 people killed by the bandits in the attacks," said one of the four sources, Balarabe Alhaji, a community leader in one of the affected villages in Zamfara state.
