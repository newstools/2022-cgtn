Trustworthy friends; good brothers; sincere partners. These phrases are frequently found in Chinese President Xi Jinping's phone conversations, letters, messages and talks with leaders of various countries. This is not just formulaic politeness, but the truth. Over the last seven-plus decades, the number of countries having diplomatic relations with China has increased from 18 in the early days of the People's Republic of China to 181 today.
