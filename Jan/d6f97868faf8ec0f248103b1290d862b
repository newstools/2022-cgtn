The Chinese Embassy in Tonga has donated 100,000 U.S. dollars in basic humanitarian assistance to the disaster-stricken island nation, Tonga's ambassador to China Tau'aika 'Uta'atu told CGTN on Thursday. Water supplies have been severely affected by ash from the volcano, said the ambassador, adding that the government is working hard to ensure that the supply of safe drinking water is adequately maintained. Restoring international transportation links and communications services such as email has been prioritized, the ambassador emphasized. The underwater Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano erupted again on January 14, and sent ash, steam and gas into the air.
