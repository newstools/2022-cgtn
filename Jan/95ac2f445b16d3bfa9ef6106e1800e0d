A group of bearded reedlings held a secret meeting in a reed marsh in Golmud City, northwest China's Qinghai Province. In winter, the lake is frozen, giving us a chance to take a closer look at these round and fluffy cuties resting on the reeds. Bearded reedlings spend their lives with reeds. They eat reed aphids in summer and reed seeds in winter. The male and female birds have a distinct look. The male has a lovely black moustache, resembling a Peking Opera character, while the female is generally paler and has no moustache.
