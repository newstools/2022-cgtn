China beat Chinese Taipei 4-0 in their first game at the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women's Asian Cup in India on Thursday, achieving a great start in the first major international women's football tournament of the year. China's ace Wang Shuang scored two goals and one assist, making the biggest contributions to the team's win at Mumbai Football Arena. The first goal happened much quicker than most expected. China's youngest player Zhang Linyan broke into the box of Chinese Taipei 80 seconds after the game began and was tackled by a defender, creating a penalty kick for her team. Wang Shuang scored the easy goal, placing China on an early 1-0 lead. Eight minutes later, Wang Shanshan of China turned her teammate's crossover from right into the second goal with a full-strength header from the middle of the box. China finished the first half with a comfortable 2-0 lead. Wang Shuang continued to bear offensive fruits for China in the second half. She drew the attention of four players of Chinese Taipei by pressing their defensive line hard at the 53rd minute before delivering the ball to Zhang Xin with a smart through ball. Zhang exploited the chance and made it 3-0 for China. Fifteen minutes later, Yao Wei's pass from left went through multiple defenders of Chinese Taipei and reached Wang Shuang, who first dodged the player that rushed to her and then scored the fourth goal for China. This was China's seventh straight win over Chinese Taipei without allowing even one goal. The "Steel Roses" have never lost to these opponents in the 21st century. Shui Qingxia, manager of China, secured a good win in the first game of the first major international tournament her team attended since she took over. China face Iran on Sunday and will book a spot in the elimination round with a win at Mumbai Football Arena.
