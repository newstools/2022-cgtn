Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte's fourth government was sworn in on Monday, a record 299 days after the last election and a year after his previous administration was forced to resign, with the coronavirus crisis looming over a big spending push. The new coalition has promised generous spending on sustainable energy, housing, childcare and education, but will first have to deal with the health crisis as the Omicron variant has pushed coronavirus infections to record levels. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday congratulated Rutte on his re-election as prime minister of the Netherlands and expressed hope to work with the new government. In the message, Li said that he looks forward to continuing to work hand in hand with Rutte to promote the open and practical comprehensive cooperative partnership between China and the Netherlands to achieve more results for the benefit of the two countries and their people.
