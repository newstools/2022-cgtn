Mount Wugui is  the highest peak in Zhongshan City, south China's Guangdong Province. As the saying goes: "Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets," Wugui Mountains have not only nourished the splendid Hakka culture, but also become a popular resort where visitors can enjoy the beautiful nature. The mountain range covers more than 200 square kilometers, and the Wugui Mountain Natural Ecological Core Reserve provides a safe harbor for different flora and fauna.
