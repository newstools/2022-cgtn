China beat Iran 7-0 in their second group game at the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women's Asian Cup at Mumbai Football Arena on Sunday. With two wins in their hands, the "Steel Roses" have booked an early seat in the quarterfinals. China's ace striker Wang Shuang secured a "hat trick," the best present to celebrate her 27th birthday. She scored the first goal on a full-power blow outside the box in the 28th minute. Fifteen minutes later, Xiao Yuyi cut into the goal area where she received the through ball from Zhang Xin. With a smart poke, Xiao extended the lead to 2-0 for China. Wang Shuang's second goal was a penalty kick earned by Li Mengwen three minutes into the second half. Wang Shanshan scored the following two goals for China in nine minutes. She beat two Iranian defenders on her own and shot the ball into the center of the net. Then she hit Xiao's crossover from right into the goal with her thigh. Chinese players did not stop at their 5-0 lead. Tang Jiali, who plays for Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, scored a long shot with her left foot in the 76th minute. China's last goal came from Wang Shuang. Tang raised the ball over the head of Iran's goalkeeper to assist Wang Shuang for a header, sealing the victory at 7-0. The other game of the group between India and Chinese Taipei did not take place after India failed to assemble enough players due to COVID-19. It's unclear whether the game will be postponed or canceled, but it won't affect China's way to the knockout stage. China have a good chance of leading Group A and if they do, their opponents in the quarterfinals will be the third-placed team of Group B or Group C.
