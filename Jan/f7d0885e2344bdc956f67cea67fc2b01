This year's World Economic Forum (WEF) will be held from Monday to Friday. Under the theme "Working together to regain trust," world leaders will gather to discuss critical challenges facing the world today and ideas on how to address them. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the week-long virtual event will take place first on the WWE website and social media channels. The in-person meeting is postponed to the end of June if the situation allows, according to the WEF. The event will cover topics including accelerating the race to net-zero emissions, navigating energy transition, rebuilding trust in global trade and supply chains, meeting the challenge of vaccine equity, and using data solutions to prepare against the next pandemic. The event will also mark the launch of several WEF initiatives covering the pressing issues the world faces. Many national leaders will attend and give speeches during the forum, with Chinese President Xi Jinping delivering the first special address at the beginning of the forum on Monday, from Beijing via video link. It will be Xi's third speech at the forum. In a special address to the event via video link in January 2021, the Chinese president championed multilateralism. He attended the Davos, Switzerland event in 2017, where he promoted economic globalization and warned against protectionism in his keynote speech.
