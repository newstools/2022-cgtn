The leadership of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) on Sunday here announced a flurry of harsher sanctions on Mali. Leaders of ECOWAS gathered in an extraordinary summit to deliberate on the situation in Mali. In the communique after the summit, the regional body said the proposed chronogram by the Malian transitional authorities that set the duration of the transition for a total of five and a half years is "totally unacceptable." The communique said all ECOWAS member states would immediately withdraw their ambassadors from Mali.
