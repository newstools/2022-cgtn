As the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games approach, CGTN Global Stringer invited Brazilian residents to talk about what the Olympic spirit means to them, as well their wishes for the participants at the Games. "During this difficult period, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the athletes have already had to give the best of themselves, just the fact that they are in these Games means that they are all winners," a former Olympic athlete says in the video. "This Olympics is going to be a milestone in an important place."
