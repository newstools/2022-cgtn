U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has tested positive for COVID-19, he said on Twitter on Sunday. "I tested positive this morning for COVID-19. I requested the test today after exhibiting symptoms while at home on leave. My symptoms are mild, and I am following my physician's directions," Austin said. He further stated that his meeting with U.S. President Joe Biden was on December 21, more than a week before his symptoms began. "I tested negative that very morning. I have not been in the Pentagon since Thursday, where I met briefly and only with a few staff. We were properly masked and socially distanced throughout," Austin added. The defense secretary said he will quarantine at home for the next five days, attend key meetings virtually and retain all authorities.
