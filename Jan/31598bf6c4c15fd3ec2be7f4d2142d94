The upland buzzard is the largest buzzard in the world based on total length and wingspan. The bird of prey can be found in Central Asia, northern South Asia and East Asia. They inhabit mountainous areas, plains and grasslands, and catch rodents, frogs, lizards, rabbits, snakes, pika, marmot and other animals for food. Photographer Lin Ge captured some cool close-up photos of a flying upland buzzard in Daqing City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. Check them out!
