China lost to Japan 2-0 in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Asian Football Confederation (AFC) qualification game at Saitama Stadium on Thursday. After this loss, the Chinese national team's hopes of making the World Cup in Qatar at the end of the year are hanging by a thread. Yuya Osako and Junya Ito scored the two goals for Japan. In the 12th minute, Ito broke into China's box from right. Wang Shen tried to block his pass but the ball hit his right arm, leading to a penalty kick for Japan. Osako scored, giving his team an early 1-0 lead. Japan's second goal was scored in the 60th minute when Yuta Nakayama delivered the ball to the center of China's box with a cross from left. All three Chinese defenders watched the ball without noticing Ito who was cutting in from the outside. With a powerful header, Ito made it 2-0 for Japan. China did not even take their first shot until the 69th minute when Wei Shihao blew a free kick to the top left corner. Though it didn't wasn't a goal, it was an excellent attempt. However, it was too little and happened too late. China's manager Li Xiaopeng said at the post-game press conference he would take full responsibility for the loss. "China have had no warm-up games to play for a long time. We thought we could use the first 20 to 30 minutes to adapt to the pace of the game, but it didn't work so well. When we allowed the second goal and trailed 2-0, it was basically hopeless for us to tie the game," Li said. This was China's ninth loss against Japan in the past 24 years, during which China has never won. China failed to win any of their recent four games in the World Cup AFC qualification tournament. They only have five points after seven games, ranking fifth in Group B and nine points away from third-placed Australia. China will play against Vietnam, Saudi Arabia and Oman in their last three games.
