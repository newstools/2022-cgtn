A massive underwater volcanic eruption near the South Pacific island nation of Tonga on January 15 triggered a tsunami that spread across the ocean in a matter of hours. Waves hit Australia, New Zealand and Japan, as well as the west coasts of North and South America, and an atmospheric shockwave was detected around the world. Images showed cars, roads and buildings in the capital Nuku'alofa coated in a film of ash. The dust has hampered relief planes from landing and delivering much-needed food and drinking water. International communication links are said to have been restored, but a severed undersea cable may take weeks to fix. International aid is heading to Tonga to help the post-disaster recovery and reconstruction.
