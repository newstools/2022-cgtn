Victory bouquets are a key feature of Olympic award ceremonies. But this year's bouquets will be a bit different. Medalists will receive woolen bouquets on the Olympic podium in Beijing. The wool-knit bouquets reflect the Games' green, economical and low-carbon theme, as they will never wither and are easy to transport. Medalists can bring them home and preserve them as an honor forever.
