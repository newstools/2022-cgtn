It's just weeks before the start of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. We've invited guests from the two previous countries and the next country to host the Olympic games to discuss how it feels to be an Olympic host. They are Dr. Won Jae LEE, commission member of the Korean Sports & Olympic Committee and associate professor at Kookmin University in Seoul; Justin Downes, the President of Axis Leisure Management; and Michele Geraci, former Under-Secretary of State at the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.
