The clean-up efforts are ramping up in Tonga, which is still covered by thick volcanic ash following eruption and tsunami. A Royal New Zealand Air Force C-130 Hercules has arrived in Tonga to help clear the Tongatapu airport runway, Radio New Zealand reported Thursday citing its Defense Force's Commander of Joint Forces Jim Gilmour. Gilmour said that a New Zealand maritime sustainment vessel HMNZS Aotearoa, carrying 250,000 liters of water and able to produce 70,000 liters per day through a desalination plant, is expected to arrive in Tonga on Friday. A third navy ship carrying relief supplies and portable seawater desalination machine will be dispatched from New Zealand on Saturday and will touch down in Tonga on Tuesday.
