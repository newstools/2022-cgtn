"Cool China," a CGTN Beijing 2022 Winter Games special series, will portray snow and ice sports activities in three Chinese locations and explore unique folk customs. Short videos will be presented, highlighting people's lives, embracing diversity and encouraging more involvement in winter sports. CGTN journalists will travel to the three locations embedded with their own winter features: Changbai Mountain in northeastern Jilin province, Altay City in northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region and Sand Lake in Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, also in the northwest. Local winter activities like snow swing, snow tug of war and snow cave hot pot in a minus 20℃ snow castle will be showcased. The presenters will also talk to inheritors of traditional fur skiing in Altay, which claims to be the birthplace of skiing. In tracing the background and history of Chinese winter activities and folk customs among different ethnic minority groups in welcoming Chinese New Year, the series revolves around a consolidated theme that the atmosphere of the Beijing 2022 Winter Games is not limited to the host venues, but is about the whole Cool China.
