Romania's government will widen energy price caps and subsidies for households and some companies from the start of February to further soften the blow of higher power and gas bills, Prime Minister Nicolae Ciuca said late on Monday. The European Union state had already introduced a support scheme for households based on caps and subsidies up to certain monthly consumption levels.
