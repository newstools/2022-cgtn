Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted a virtual summit commemorating the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the five Central Asian countries (C+C5) on Tuesday in Beijing. Following the summit, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng introduced the results to the media. The summit is the first major multilateral diplomatic event hosted by China this year, and it is also the first collective meeting between China and the heads of the C5 in 30 years, which is a milestone of historic importance, Le said. The most important outcome of the summit is that the two sides announced they will build a community with a shared future for China and Central Asian countries and usher in a new era of interrelationships, the vice foreign minister added.
