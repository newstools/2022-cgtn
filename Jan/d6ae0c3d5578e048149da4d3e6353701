Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi called on the two countries to expand cooperation in agriculture and food products, e-commerce and the digital economy during a meeting with Estonian Foreign Minister Eva-Maria Liimets via video link on Monday. Hailing the sound development of bilateral relations since the establishment of diplomatic ties more than 30 years ago, Wang said past experience shows that as long as the two countries respect and treat each other equally, they can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results. The two sides should continue to attach importance to each other's legitimate concerns in core interests, abide by the international relations norms of non-interference in internal affairs and safeguard the political foundation of bilateral relations, he said. Liimets pledged to firmly adhere to the one-China policy, enhance mutual trust, and jointly promote the development of bilateral relations. Estonia supports the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and has co-sponsored a resolution on Olympic Truce for the Beijing Winter Olympic Games, she said, expressing hope that the Olympic Games will be a complete success. The two sides agreed to continue to maintain communication, hold diplomatic and political consultations in due course and speed up the signing process for exporting Estonian dairy and wild aquatic products to China. The two foreign ministers also exchanged views on green and digital cooperation and believe that international cooperation should be strengthened to jointly address global challenges such as climate change, and strive to build a safe, open and cooperative cyberspace.
