"摸鱼" literally is to feel fish with your hands, as it originally refers to the idiom "浑水摸鱼" to fish in the muddy water. Today, it has a new meaning to describe a status that office workers are cyberslacking or cyberloafing. Specifically, it's about doing something irrelevant to your work during office hours.
