The Southern Africa Development Community (SADC), a regional bloc, has underscored the need for member states to strengthen the region's mission in Mozambique's northern province of Cabo Delgado until there's peace. The resolution was made at the SADC Extraordinary Summit for Heads of State and Government that was convened Wednesday in Lilongwe, Malawi, to review the regional body's Standby Mission to Mozambique (SAMIM).
