New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said her government will provide 500,000 New Zealand dollars (NZD) of assistance to Tonga, which has been battered by a volcano eruption and subsequent tsunami on Saturday. Communications with the Pacific island have been cut since Saturday's eruption damaged undersea cables, but Ardern said her government had made contact with the New Zealand High Commission in the Tongan capital.
