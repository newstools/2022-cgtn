Dozens of Palestinian protesters were injured on Friday during clashes with Israeli soldiers near two cities in northern West Bank, medics and eyewitnesses said. Palestinian medics said that at least 15 demonstrators were injured by rubber-coated metal gunshots and dozens suffered suffocation after they inhaled the tear gas fired by the Israeli soldiers near Nablus and Qalqilya.
