China has lodged stern representations with the U.S. over recent meetings between Taiwan region official Lai Ching-te and several U.S. lawmakers, including House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Sunday. China strongly opposes any official interactions between the U.S. and the Taiwan region, Zhao said. "We urge the U.S. side to abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, and not to send wrong signals to 'Taiwan independence' separatists, so as not to damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits," Zhao said.
