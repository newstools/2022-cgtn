Wurin, 31, a fur ski master, lives in Tuva Kanas Village in Altay Prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. He works in the tourism industry during peak season from summer to fall, and in winter, he enjoys skiing on his beloved fur skis to continue chasing his dream. Fur skis, made of pine and horsehide, have a history of more than 12,000 years in Altay Prefecture. The graining of the horsehide on such skis provides friction to help skiers climb mountains while enabling them to still glide smoothly downhill.
