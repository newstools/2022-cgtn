China and the United States signed a "Phase-One Trade Deal" in January 2020, in hopes of ending a damaging trade war. After two years, the deal by no means brought an end to the friction. Beijing called on the U.S. to create more favorable conditions for trade. The U.S. accused China of not properly implementing the deal. David Blair, vice president of the Center for China and Globalization, talks about his assessment and prediction for their trade ties in the future. He points out that the U.S. still sees China as a long-term competitor.
