Twelve years ago, Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo won China's first Olympic gold medal in figure skating; now, they're leading the next generation of China's figure skaters to prepare for the Beijing Winter Olympics. With new roles and the same passion for the sport, how are they influencing China's progress? Can the new generation surpass the glory days? And how is the Chinese team ushering in a new era of figure skating culture in China? To find out more, we've invited Shen Xue, President of the Chinese Figure Skating Association. In the second half of the show, we'll also be joined by Spyros Capralos, President of the Greek Olympic Committee, to get his insights about China and Greece's relationship in sports and other cultural activities, and his views on the politicization of sport.
