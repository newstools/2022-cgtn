An attack by two drones reportedly struck the U.S. Victory Base on Monday at Baghdad International Airport, according to local media. Two drones were shot down by the U.S. defense system, according to photo footage released on social media. The written scripts on the wings of drones roughly translate to "Leader's revenge" and "Soleimani's revenge."
