"祖安" is the name of a region in the fictional world of the game Leagues of Legends, and also the name of a specific online game server, in which the players are known for their trash talking during the play. Their words can be impolite and humiliating in many cases, but some linguistically sophisticated sarcasms do bring a laugh. Therefore, it is often used to describe somebody who trash talks a lot.
