U.S. bobsledder Josh Williamson's future as a medal contender at the Beijing Winter Olympics is in doubt after he tested positive for COVID-19. The 25-year-old Floridian announced the news via Instagram on Wednesday night, just hours before the Team USA charter flight was scheduled to depart for the games, which start February 4. "Sunday morning I tested positive for COVID-19, so I will not be on @teamusa's flight to Beijing tomorrow," Williamson wrote. "This has not been an easy pill to swallow. I have felt pretty helpless throughout this process, but I've also found myself laughing a bit at the situation I'm in.  "Isn't it ironic that after 4 years of hard work, all there is to do is sit, rest, recover and have faith? Things I struggle to do the most."  Williamson also revealed that he might get on a later flight to Beijing if the situation improves, as the bobsleigh events don't start until February 13. "I just need consistent negatives to be on one," he said. "The support I received after making the team has been incredible and it has meant the world to me. I hope I get the chance to compete for you all!" U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton can't comment on whether any other athlete's Olympic travel is affected by COVID, a U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee spokesperson was quoted as saying by the NBC news. "As with Josh, any athlete who tests positive will have the opportunity to test negative and make a flight in time to train and compete," the spokesperson added. Williamson is the first American athlete named to the 2022 Olympic team to test positive. The U.S. are sending 222 athletes to Beijing 2022. It is the second-largest U.S. contingent ever at the Olympic Winter Games, behind the 228-member team at PyeongChang 2018 and equaling the 222-strong side to Sochi 2014.
