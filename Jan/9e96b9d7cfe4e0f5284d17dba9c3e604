The music for Peking Opera is like the compass for sailing, in the sense that artists know when to enter the stage, to perform, to present the fighting skills and to sing according to the signals given by the live band sitting next to the main stage. Moreover, contemporary Peking Opera musicians are not satisfied with just "giving signals," and they step on a journey to create something new, a blended "musical cocktail" mixed with traditional Peking Opera instruments with modern musical elements.
