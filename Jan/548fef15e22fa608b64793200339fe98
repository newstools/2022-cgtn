What might the Beijing 2022 Winter Games opening ceremony on February 4 look like? Clues can be found from a 30-minute warm-up show held a few days before the ceremony, and it has been rehearsed thrice with full-dress and audiences. "We have been training for this almost every day since September," Li Jinghai, a dancer for the opening ceremony, said. "I've never performed on a stage like this, and at the Bird's Nest. I'm so excited and I'm looking forward to the opening ceremony," Zhang Jiadi, another dancer, said. "We've incorporated many details in the warm-up about Chinese New Year, as well as international elements. With these, we want to show our blessings and our love for the Winter Games," Fei Xiang, a staff member of the opening ceremony, said. Details such as the lighting of the Olympic flame will remain a secret, which is said to have a stunning visual effect no one has seen before. The Beijing 2022 is held at a special time during the global pandemic, based on an idea of "simple, safe, and impressive," which also describes the opening and closing ceremonies. The Beijing 2008 Summer Games had about 15,000 performers while the Beijing 2022 has about 3,000, but the organizers said that the opening ceremony will be impressive. The opening ceremony will be held at Lichun, a Chinese solar term meaning the arrival of Spring, and it hopes to pass on a message of hope, light, and solidarity.
