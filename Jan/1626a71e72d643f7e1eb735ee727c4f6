The Almaty International Airport in Kazakhstan will resume operations on January 13, the country's civil aviation commission announced on Wednesday. Earlier in the day, Almaty's press department issued a notice saying that the airport will resume operations when the city ends its state of emergency. The department later apologized for posting the wrong information. According to Interfax news agency, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev arrived in Almaty on Wednesday. Some roads near the city's government buildings were under traffic control while helicopters patrolled in the air. According to a decree signed by Tokayev, the state of emergency in Almaty would be implemented from January 5 to 19 to ensure public safety after fuel price protests in the country.
