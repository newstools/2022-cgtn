British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced on Saturday that the UK is poised to offer NATO a "major" deployment of troops, weapons, warships and fighter aircraft in Europe in order to respond to rising "Russian hostility" toward Ukraine. "This package would send a clear message to the Kremlin...we will not tolerate their destabilizing activity, and we will always stand with our NATO allies in the face of Russian hostility," Johnson said in a statement.
