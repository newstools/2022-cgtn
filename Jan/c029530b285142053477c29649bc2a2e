Facebook has temporarily suspended U.S. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene's account on Monday for 24 hours, a day after Twitter announced a permanent suspension on the Republican congresswoman's account for violating the platform's COVID-19 misinformation policy. Facebook told NBC News that one of Greene's posts violated their policies and they had removed it.
