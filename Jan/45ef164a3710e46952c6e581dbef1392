Japan has announced it is sending its largest delegation of athletes to an overseas Winter Olympics with 124 athletes competing. The total Japanese contingent that will take part in Beijing Winter Games next month will number 262. "We will do our best so that the performances of athletes in the Winter Games can deliver courage and brightness throughout Japan and help create hopes for the future," said speed skater Miho Takagi during a ceremony held in Tokyo's Minato Ward on Saturday to send off the Japanese delegation. "It was difficult for us because of the pandemic in the past two years," the 27-year-old added. "But thanks to the efforts from the society and the people around us, we are able to celebrate this moment today. We will do our utmost to ensure that each athlete can reach their full potential." A three-time Olympian, Takagi was named Japan's team captain for Beijing 2022, while her fellow speed skater Arisa Go and Nordic combined skier Akito Watabe will serve as flag-bearers for the showpiece event's opening ceremony on February 4. "I hope that your hard work will pay off and you will perform well," said Japan's Crown Prince Akishino, who attended the ceremony with his wife, Crown Princess Kiko. The sentiment was echoed by Japan's chef de mission Ito Hidehito. "Hopefully we can do better than four years ago," he said. "We aim to win more gold medals than we did in the PyeongChang Olympics." In 2018, Japan earned 13 medals at PyeongChang, surpassing the country's previous Winter Olympic record of 10 medals at the Nagano Olympics in 1998. Meanwhile, 43 Japanese athletes finished top eight in their respective sports in South Korea, breaking another record.
