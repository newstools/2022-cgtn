Home favorite Ashleigh Barty of Australia defeated Danielle Collins of the U.S. 6-3, 7-6(2) in the Australian Open women's singles final at Melbourne Park on Saturday, earning her third Grand Slam major title. Barty became the first Australian women's singles champion of the tournament in 44 years. She also joined Serena Williams to become the second active female tennis player who has won three of the four majors as well as the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) Finals championship. "This is just a dream come true for me and I'm just so proud to be an Aussie," Barty said. The Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup cost Barty 14 straight sets and 30 games to achieve, which makes the fewest since Steffi Graf in 1989. The first set did not take many efforts for Barty to win 6-3. She first beat Collins' attempt for a break in the fifth game and then accomplished a break of her own in the sixth game to lead 4-2. When Barty took Game 9, it had been only 32 minutes since the match began. Collins refused to lose without decent resistance. She gained two breaks in the second and sixth games of the second frame, which Barty has never encountered in the tournament until the final match. When the Australian finally found her way to deal with Collins' aggressive returns, she was already trailing 5-1. However, like Collins' trademark fierce groundstrokes, Barty's rally happened hard and fast via two breaks in Game 7 and Game 9. When the second set reached 6-6, Barty became the one with full momentum. Having never allowed Collins on top again, Barty secured the tie-breaker 7-2 to seal the competition.
