The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) on Tuesday successfully conducted a "hypersonic gliding warhead" test, which was supervised by top leader Kim Jong Un and other top officials, the Korean Central News Agency reported on Wednesday. The report said the missile test was conducted by the Academy of Defense Science for the final verification of the hypersonic weapon system's technical specifications. After being released from the rocket booster, a hypersonic glide vehicle made a 600-km "glide jump flight" and then 240 km of "corkscrew maneuvering" before hitting a target in waters 1,000 km away, the news agency said. While watching the test, Kim encouraged the national defense scientific research sector to continuously bolster the country's war deterrent capabilities. The Republic of Korea said on Tuesday that its military detected the projectile, presumed to be a ballistic missile which the DPRK launched from its inland area into the East Sea at about 7:27 a.m. local time. It was the DPRK's second missile test in 2022. The DPRK said last week that it successfully test-fired a hypersonic missile on January 5.
