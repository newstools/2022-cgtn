Kazakhstan has ended its state of emergency following riots in early January. Kazakh authorities insist order has been restored after weeks of unrest but say counter-terrorism operations are ongoing. Riots began over widespread outrage over rising fuel prices and 227 people died amid escalating violence. Former Kazakh president Nursultan Nazarbayev made a public appearance on Tuesday, his first since the unrest. The former president addressed claims of a rift in the country's leadership.
