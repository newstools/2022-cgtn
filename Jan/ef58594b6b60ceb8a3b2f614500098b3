At least four people reportedly died over the weekend as a blizzard swept through parts of the U.S. East Coast. Three of the dead were found in the snow next to their shovels on Long Island, New York, on Saturday, while a snow plow driver found an elderly woman dead inside her vehicle overnight in Uniondale, also on Long Island, according to local media.
