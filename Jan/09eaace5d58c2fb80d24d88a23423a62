China is firmly opposed to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC)'s decision to revoke authorization for China Unicom's U.S. unit to operate in the United States, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said on Friday. The U.S. move seriously deviates from market principles and damages the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies and consumers, including U.S. users. The move also undermines the normal international economic and trade order, noted the spokesperson.
