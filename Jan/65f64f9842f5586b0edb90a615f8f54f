The three Olympic Villages for the coming 2022 Winter Games opened for a pre-Games trial on Sunday. Advance groups of over 20 delegations from China, Britain, Australia and other countries will enter the villages. Before the advance groups can enter the villages of their competition zones, they need to first go to the village in Beijing to complete final registration which includes confirming qualification for their events, the number of registered members in the delegation and their access to each of the villages, as well as other issues before the villages get ready to host the delegations. The pre-Games trial will come to an end on January 27, after which all three villages will officially open to all delegations. The 2022 Winter Olympics will take place between February 4 and 20 in the three competition zones of Beijing, Yanqing District also of Beijing and Zhangjiakou in north China's Hebei Province. There is one Olympic village in each of the competition zones. The operation and management teams of the villages told China Media Group (CMG) that they will continue to refine details of the services for the delegations to make sure that every participant in Beijing 2022 can feel like they are at home.
