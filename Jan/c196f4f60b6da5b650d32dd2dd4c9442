French President Emmanuel Macron held a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi on Saturday. Macron said a deal on Iran's nuclear activities was still possible but insisted on the need to boost efforts, according to statements from Macron's office on Sunday. Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi made it clear that any genuine attempt to hammer out an agreement in the Vienna talks needs to entail the removal of the sanctions on Iran in a verifiable manner and provide solid guarantees for Tehran, Tasnim News Agency reported.
