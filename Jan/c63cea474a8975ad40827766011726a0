A pair of giant Spring Festival couplets were unveiled at Nanjing's Zhonghua Gate on Sunday to celebrate the upcoming lunar Chinese New Year, known as Spring Festival. A pair of 15-meter-long, two-meter-wide red Spring Festival couplets were unveiled at the Zhonghua Gate. The ceremony creatively uses the 650-year-old cultural heritage. It is also a new Chinese New Year custom in the city as the event only began seven years ago. After the unveiling ceremony, couplets will be displayed successively at 13 city gates, such as Zhongshan, Xuanwu, Jiefang, and Taiping, among others. Since the start of the collection of Spring Festival couplets, nearly 10,000 have signed up for application within a month, but only 13 couplets were selected.
