All 14 teams have been confirmed for the NFL playoffs after the final week of regular season games concluded on Sunday. The Pittsburgh Steelers secured a berth after their tough win over the Baltimore Ravens, but they also should thank the Las Vegas Raiders for not pulling punches against the Los Angeles Chargers. The San Francisco 49ers also pushed their way into the postseason by upsetting the Los Angeles Rams on the road while their quarterback, Jimmy Garoppolo, battled a torn thumb ligament. They will join the New England Patriots, Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals to challenge the heavyweights: Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Green Bay Packers and Kansas City Chiefs. Meanwhile, do the Cincinnati Bengals, Buffalo Bills and Dallas Cowboys have what it takes to make more surprises?
