U.S. President Joe Biden approved a federal disaster declaration for seven southeast Missouri counties in the Heartland affected by tornadoes, severe storms and straight-line winds, the White House said on Tuesday. "Federal funding is available to state and eligible local governments and certain private nonprofit organizations on a cost-sharing basis for emergency work and the repair or replacement of facilities damaged by the severe storms, straight-line winds, and tornadoes in the counties of Bollinger, Dunklin, Iron, Madison, Pemiscot, Reynolds, and Wayne," the White House said in a statement.
