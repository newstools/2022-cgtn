China's industrial profits in December grew by 4.2 percent compared with a year earlier, sliding from November's 9-percent growth, data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed on Thursday. It was the second straight month of growth at single-digit speed, slowing sharply from the 24.6-percent gain reported in October. The profits of China's major industrial firms stood at 734.2 billion yuan ($115.8 billion) in December, down from 805.96 billion yuan in the previous month. The slower growth in the last two months of 2021 was lifted by the strong performance in previous months which showed fast recovery and growth. For the full year of 2021, the annual profits of the country's major industrial firms totaled over 8.7 trillion yuan, increasing by 34.3 percent compared to the earlier year. In 2020, China's industrial firms grew 4.1 percent year on year to 6.45 trillion yuan. (Cover photo via CFP)
