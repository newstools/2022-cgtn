European football clubs can start calling the players that will become free agents in summer after the winter transfer window opened on Saturday. That means Real Madrid can reach out to Kylian Mbappe, negotiate about his contract and share details of the grand plan they have for him. Teams that are kind enough to do Manchester United a favor by signing Paul Pogba can talk to the world champion midfielder about his ego problem. Chelsea may want to pay some attention to the players in their lineup that may become free agents in summer and leave a costly vacancy.
