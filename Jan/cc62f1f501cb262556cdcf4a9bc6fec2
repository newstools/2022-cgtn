The power of Olympics sportsmanship and camaraderie in bringing people together. With the winter games less than one months away, CGTN Host Tian Wei talked to an insider, Ivo Ferriani. He's the president of the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation, or IBSF. The sports of Bobsleigh and Skeleton are known as "F1 on Ice". They are vital parts of the Winter Olympic Games. Ivo Ferriani told Tian Wei that people will see fantastic results in Beijing. And he added that for most of the athletes it is the only chance to compete in the Olympics in their entire life. So he doesn't like when politicians try to use athletes for their own gains.
