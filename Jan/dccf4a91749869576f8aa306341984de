After a month of collaboration, four musicians are in the final stage of production of CGTN's Winter Olympics theme tune ahead of its release. The tune is co-produced by Asr and Mico Liu Wei from China, Doctor Victor from Iceland and Carlo Facchini from Italy. Using a relay format, each artist composed a one-minute piece within seven days that reflects their musical tastes and understanding of winter sports and the Beijing Winter Olympics. The tune, which draws on the Beijing 2022 motto, "Together for a Shared Future," starts with Asr's interpretation of the Mongolian instrument, the Matouqin. He then pivots to Mico's Chinese traditional five-tone dynamic electronic music, followed by Doctor Victor's Nordic elements combination of passion and reason, and Facchini's fusion of Italian classical and romantic styles. Treat your ears to a musical composition that bridges China and the world, past and modernity. Stay tuned to CGTN for the unveiling of the tune in celebration of the one-month countdown to the Beijing Winter Olympics, which kicks off on February 4.
