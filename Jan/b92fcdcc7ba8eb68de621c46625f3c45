Chinese President Xi Jinping's three speeches delivered at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the past five years have all come at critical times of global change. At the WEF, Xi expounded on China's views on economic globalization in 2017, advocated multilateralism in 2021, and proposed plans for building a better world in the post-pandemic era this year. China can make huge contributions and present practical solutions to address global issues, Klaus Schwab, WEF's founder and executive chairman, said in an interview with Yuyuantantian, a social media account under China Media Group. Schwab also said that we have to make progress this year. "Otherwise, our children and our grandchildren will ask us how did you miss this opportunity which you had in 2022?" he said.
