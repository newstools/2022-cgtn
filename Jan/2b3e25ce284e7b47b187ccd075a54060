U.S. President Joe Biden approved a major disaster declaration on Friday following massive fires in Colorado. The order will help expedite aid and rebuilding for those who lost their homes, Governor Jared Polis said at a news conference the same day. As many as 1,000 homes were lost on Thursday when a wildfire "moving at a speed and magnitude we have never seen before" swept across several miles of Colorado's eastern plains, devastating two suburban communities. No casualties have yet been reported, though at least six people were injured and tens of thousands evacuated in and around towns near Denver on Thursday.
