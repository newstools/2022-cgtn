Denmark football star Christian Eriksen said he's been aiming to play again for the Danish national team at the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Qatar at the end of 2022. "My goal is to play in the World Cup in Qatar, that's been my mindset all along. Whether I'll be picked is another thing, but it's my dream to come back. So until then I'm just going to play and prove that I'm back at the same level," Eriksen said. The former Inter Milan midfielder suffered a cardiac arrest in the UEFA European Championship game against Finland in Copenhagen last year. He received life-saving treatment on the field while his teammates surrounded him in a circle. The moment the Danish national team escorted Eriksen off of the pitch became one of the most touching scenes in last year's Euros. "At the hospital, they kept saying I'd received more and more flowers," Eriksen said. "It was weird, because I didn't expect people to send flowers because I'd died for five minutes." Eriksen had a heart-starter device implanted in his body. Since that is not permitted in Italy, he had his contract with Inter terminated. Fortunately, there are clubs accepting of the device. For example, his former teammate Daley Blind, who plays for Ajax in the Eredivisie, has a similar device inside him and is still playing for the club. Eriksen's market value was 90 million euros (about $101.8 million) when he was in peak form in 2019. He tallied 69 goals and 90 assists in 3,025 appearances for Tottenham Hotspur of the Premier League. If he can regain 60 or 70 percent of that form, there will be enough teams reaching out to him. According to Eriksen, his heart is no longer an obstacle. "They (the doctors) have said 'fine,' said it's good, so everything is stable, which therefore feels like a green light to be able to play football again," he said.
