Ukraine's court has frozen property owned by former President Petro Poroshenko as part of a formal investigation into alleged high treason by the former head of state, the Prosecutor General's office said on Thursday. Ukrainian prosecutors said Poroshenko was involved in financing separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014-2015. He denies the allegations.
