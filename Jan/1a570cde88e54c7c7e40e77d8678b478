Longtime standout forward Josefine Jakobsen, veteran defender Simone Jacquet and promising goaltender Cassandra Repstock-Romme were among those who made it to the Denmark women's hockey team for their maiden trip to the Olympics. The Danish women advanced to the Winter Games for the first time in history after winning their Final Olympic Qualification tournament in Fussen, Germany in November. The breakthrough marks a historic double for ice hockey in Denmark, which back in August witnessed their men's team also secured an Olympic berth for the first time ever. "We are a good team with a good mix of experienced and young players, and we have been in a really good period since before the coronavirus pandemic," observed Jakobsen, who has captained the women's team since 2018. "It was incredible that we qualified for the Olympics, and the Winter Olympics will be an incredible experience," the 30-year-old added. "But we are not going to Beijing for a holiday. We're going with the aim of delivering some really good results, and I don't think a quarterfinal place is unrealistic." Jakobsen and Co. are coached by widely respected Swedish Peter Elander, who guided his home country's women team to Olympic silver in Turin in 2006 and bronze at the World Championships in 2005 and 2007 during a successful nine-year stint. "Denmark have strong talents, and I know many of the players and know what they stand for," said Elander. "I believe that the teamwork and team spirit is in order. It's an outstanding challenge." For the first time at the Olympics, the women's ice hockey competition features 10 teams. Denmark are paired with hosts China, Sweden, Japan and the Czech Republic in Group B. The defending champions USA, which named their squad last week, will slug it out against Canada, Switzerland, Finland and the Russian Olympic Committee team in Group A.
