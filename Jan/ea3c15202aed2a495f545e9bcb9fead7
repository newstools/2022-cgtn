The three central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan suffered power outages in major cities on Tuesday, after a major power line in Kazakhstan was disconnected. Authorities in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan said they were restarting power plants after emergency shutdowns and would initially remain disconnected from the Central Asian grid. Outages were also reported in Kazakhstan's largest city Almaty and several major southern cities close to the Uzbek and Kyrgyz borders.
