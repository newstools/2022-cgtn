After days of violent protests, Kazakhstan is restoring facilities in the largest city of Almaty and other regions hit by the violent attacks, as its President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev urges. Tokayev said that his country had weathered an attempted coup d'etat thanks to troops from the Russian-led Collective Security Treaty Organization. Chinese President Xi Jinping also sent condolences to Kazakh President Tokayev. What's behind the chaos? What happens next? And how will it impact neighboring countries and regional stability? To find out, we've invited Djoomart Otorbaev, former Prime Minister of Kyrgyzstan; Einar Tangen, independent current affairs commentator; and Wang Jin, associate professor from Northwest University of China.
