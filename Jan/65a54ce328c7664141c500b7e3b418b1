In less than a week, 166 international athletes will compete at China's National Speed Skating Oval, known as the "Ice Ribbon," for medals during the Winter Olympic Games. Teams from around the world are still arriving in Beijing, and many have begun training. "Technical delegates from the International Skating Union and international referees have arrived and they are very satisfied with the venue and services," the deputy venue manager of the National Speed Skating Oval, Zhou Qiurui said, adding that the advanced carbon dioxide cooling technology used to make Asia's largest ice surface has received positive feedback from athletes. Members of the Dutch delegation were also pleased with the competition venue in Beijing. "Circumstances are perfect. I think we will enjoy top quality sports," Carl Mureau, press officer of Team Netherlands, said. "The races will be exciting on every distance we have. Of course, I hope the Dutch will win the most medals of all." Dutch speed skater Irene Schouten echoed Mureau. "My first impression is really good. The track is amazing. It's really beautiful," she said. Meanwhile, broadcasting services are ready in the Ice Ribbon, and the team is equipped with the most advanced devices and technologies. Zhou said that COVID-19 measures are in place and more than 60 volunteers have been helping people inside and outside the venue. From Monday, three rounds of test competitions will be held before the official events begin on Saturday.
