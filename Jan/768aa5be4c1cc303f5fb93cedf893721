The World Health Organization (WHO) approved two new COVID-19 treatments on Friday, growing the arsenal of tools along with vaccines to stave off severe illness and death from the virus. In their recommendation in British medical journal The BMJ, WHO experts said arthritis drug baricitinib used with corticosteroids to treat severe or critical COVID-19 patients led to better survival rates and reduced need for ventilators. Experts also recommended synthetic antibody treatment Sotrovimab for people with non-serious COVID-19 at highest risk of hospitalization, such as the elderly, people with immunodeficiencies or chronic diseases such as diabetes.
