The week-long Davos Agenda 2022 wrapped up on Friday after offering an opportunity for world leaders to reflect on the "State of the World" and shape solutions for critical challenges in the year ahead. Two years since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year the virtual Davos summit focused on driving concerted action among key global stakeholders, with key sessions covering issues including the COVID-19 pandemic, the 4th Industrial Revolution, the climate crisis, and the global economic outlook. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) said on Friday that the world economy is losing momentum, despite a continued recovery. The IMF also warned of a growing divergence among countries. Earlier in the event, the UN chief appealed to the world to help the low-income countries to recover and fight the pandemic. "The last two years have demonstrated a simple but brutal truth. If you leave anyone behind, in the end, we leave everyone behind," said Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General. In a speech delivered at the event, Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the world to abandon ideological prejudice and jointly follow a path of peaceful coexistence, mutual benefit and win-win cooperation. "Difference in itself is no cause for alarm. What does ring the alarm is arrogance, prejudice and hatred," Xi said. "Everyone hopes that in 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the crises that accompanied it, will finally begin to recede. But major global challenges await us, from climate change to rebuilding trust and social cohesion. To address them, leaders will need to adopt new models, look long term, renew cooperation and act systemically," said Klaus Schwab, founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum (WEF). The WEF announced another summit will be held in person in May. (With inputs from Xinhua)
