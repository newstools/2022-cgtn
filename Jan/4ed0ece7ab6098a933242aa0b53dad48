Elena Curtoni won World Cup super-G in Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy on Sunday as fellow Italian Sofia Goggia crashed, a little over two weeks before the speed skiing events at the Beijing Winter Olympic Games.  Goggia, who leads the downhill World Cup standings, lost her balance in the third section of the treacherous course and appeared to twist a knee before getting up and slowly skiing down the piste. Tournament organizers later said the 29-year-old had sprained her left knee. "Sofia Goggia's fall in today's Super-G resulted in a sprained left knee, with a partial cruciate ligament injury already operated in 2013, a small fracture of the fibula and a muscular tendon injury," a statement read. "Sofia will start her rehabilitation with the aim to be at the (Beijing) Olympics." Goggia has won five out of the six World Cup downhills this season and was hoping to secure a double in Cortina d'Ampezzo after prevailing in Saturday's downhill at the Italian resort. The women's super-G at the Olympics is scheduled for February 11, four days before the downhill. Goggia also lost the lead in the super-G World Cup rankings to another Italian, Federica Brignone, who took fourth place. She ended up 0.32 seconds behind Curtoni, who clocked a time of one minute 20.98 seconds to beat Austrian Tamara Tippler by 0.09 and Swiss Michelle Gisin by 0.24. Brignone has 377 points in the super-G rankings to Curtoni's 348 and Goggia's 332. American Mikaela Shiffrin, who last won a World Cup super-G in 2020, took 16th place to extend her overall World Cup lead by 15 points over Czech Petra Vlhova.
