Chinese President Xi Jinping hosted a virtual summit with the leaders of Kazakhstan, Kyrgystan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties. What are some of the takeaways from the meeting? How have China and the Central Asian nations cooperated on trade, energy and security over the past 30 years? And what are the prospects for the future as China plans to invest more in the Central Asian countries? To help us answer these questions, we've invited Zhou Rong, senior fellow at the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China; Mark Sleboda, Moscow-based international affairs and security analyst; and Djoomart Otorbaev, former Prime Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic.
