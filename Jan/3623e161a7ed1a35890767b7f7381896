China on Tuesday criticized the U.S. government for being suspected of preying on 311 Danish children in the 1960s, and urged it to shoulder its due responsibility by apologizing and compensating the victims. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the comments at a press briefing in Beijing in response to a recently released Danish Radio documentary called "The Search for Myself," which revealed secret experiments that were funded by the CIA in the 1960s.
