Red squirrels are reflected in the surface of a pond as they play around the water. The rare animals were seen drinking from the pond and raiding the bird feeders in the back garden of Ian Mason. The 67-year-old resident in rural Perthshire, Scotland, waited patiently for the squirrels to appear but then had to contain his laughter as he remained calm despite their hilarious antics.
