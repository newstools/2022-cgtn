China's Shenzhou-13 astronauts, or taikonauts currently in the country's space station, had a video call with youths in Beijing and Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions on Saturday afternoon. Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu, China's first astronauts to celebrate the New Year in outer space, sent their New Year greetings and answered questions from university students in the three cities. The three crew members were sent to China's space station on October 16, 2021, for a six-month mission. Up in space, they will celebrate the traditional Chinese lunar New Year — Spring Festival, which falls on February 1 this year. In reply to questions from the students, the taikonauts shared stories about their life and work in space, including how to maintain good physical and mental conditions, how to deal with expected situations and their hopes for the New Year. For the first time also, they showcased children's paintings in the space station. Click here for CGTN's live coverage of the event.
