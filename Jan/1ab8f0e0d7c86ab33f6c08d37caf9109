The Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games is less than two weeks away, and the three Olympic villages, two in Beijing's Chaoyang and Yanqing districts and one in Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, are welcoming their first guests on Sunday. Over 20 delegations have checked in some of their members ahead of the facilities' official opening on Thursday. All personnel for the Games will be in a closed-loop management system to lower the risks of COVID-19.
