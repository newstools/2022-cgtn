Dutch police on Sunday tried to break up a crowd of several thousand who had gathered in the Dutch capital Amsterdam to protest against COVID-19 lockdown measures and vaccinations. Amsterdam mayor Femke Halsema issued an emergency ordinance, empowering police to clear the central Museum Square after the protesters violated a ban on holding public gatherings during the latest wave of coronavirus infections.
