U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Wednesday said the United States will continue relentless diplomatic efforts to prevent Russian invasion in Ukraine, following his meeting in Kiev with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Speaking at a press conference with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Blinken said the U.S. would provide additional material to the ex-Soviet country beyond that which is already in the pipeline should Russia carry through with what he called "aggressive intent toward Ukraine." During the press conference, Kuleba accused Russia of wanting to sow panic and distrust and destabilize the country's financial system. "We must make every effort to prevent Russia from achieving this goal without even taking weapons out of pockets," Kuleba said. Ukraine is the first leg of Blinken's diplomatic trip. He will travel to Berlin on Thursday and meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva on Friday.
