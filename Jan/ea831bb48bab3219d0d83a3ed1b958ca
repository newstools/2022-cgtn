It's like the upgrading of cyber violence. The snowball of Xinjiang-related lies rolled across the screen and rolled into the U.S. Congress, trying to make a "social death" in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region with the guise of "human rights."

With the support of the CIA, he desperately seized the opportunity by hyping up over Xinjiang, according to a video commentary published on Chinese social media account Yuyuan Tantian.
