In May 2020, two months after declaring COVID-19 a pandemic, the WHO hosted a virtual session of the World Health Assembly. Speaking at the meeting, President Xi Jinping made a promise that any vaccine produced by China would become “a global public good”. The Chinese leader has been true to his word, with the country supplying some two billion vaccine doses, mainly to the developing world, by the end of 2021.
