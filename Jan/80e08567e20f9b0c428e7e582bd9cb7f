At least 50 people were killed by gunmen in a raid on an area of northwest Nigeria, Reuters has reported, citing residents. Abdullahi Karman Unashi, a community leader, told Reuters that dozens of armed men on motorcycles entered the area in Kebbi state on Friday night and exchanged gunfire with soldiers and policemen. Security forces were forced to retreat and the gunmen overran the area, burning shops and grain silos and stealing cattle in a raid that ran into the early hours of Saturday. (With input from Reuters)
