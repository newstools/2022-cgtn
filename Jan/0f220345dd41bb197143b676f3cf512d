The Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO) military bloc will start withdrawing its troops from Kazakhstan within two days, Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev told parliament on Tuesday. The troops will depart the Central Asian nation completely over a period of 10 days, he said. Kazakhstan asked for CSTO military assistance amid violent unrest last week.
