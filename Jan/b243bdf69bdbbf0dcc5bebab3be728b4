Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee, began a visit on Wednesday to north China's Shanxi Province ahead of Chinese New Year. Xi visited residents' homes in two villages and inspected post-disaster reconstruction in areas affected by last year's floods, as well as local efforts to restore farming, ensure public access to winter heating, consolidate and expand anti-poverty achievements, and advance rural vitalization.
