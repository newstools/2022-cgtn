A Chinese mainland spokesperson warned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority Friday against colluding with external forces to seek "Taiwan independence," saying any such attempt will be punished severely. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, urged the United States to uphold the one-China principle with concrete actions to fulfill its serious commitment not to support "Taiwan independence" and to stop playing with fire on Taiwan-related issues.
