The evaluation test-fire of a Hwasong 12-type ground-to-ground intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile was conducted on Sunday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) reported. According to the report, the test-fire aimed to selectively evaluate the missile being produced and deployed and verify the weapon system's overall accuracy. "It was conducted by the highest-angle launch system from the northwestern part of the country toward the waters of the East Sea of Korea in consideration of the security of neighboring countries," KCNA reported. The test confirmed the accuracy, security and effectiveness of the operation of the Hwasong 12-type weapon system under production, the report said. Moon Jae-in, president of the Republic of Korea (ROK), on Sunday said the latest launch was "a challenge for denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula" and for "peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula." The United States also condemned the launch, which was the seventh of its kind in January. The DPRK fired a hypersonic missile on January 5 and January 11, two railway-borne short-range ballistic missiles on January 14, two tactical guided missiles on January 17, a long-range cruise missile on January 25, and a surface-to-surface tactical guided missile on January 27. The latest escalation of tensions on the peninsula comes amid stalled denuclearization talks between the U.S. and the DPRK since 2019. Pyongyang has accused Washington of pursuing a "hostile policy" against it.
