More than 180 million doses of Sinopharm and Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines have been shipped to 49 countries through COVAX, playing a crucial global role in boosting immunity and saving lives, a senior World Health Organization (WHO) official said on Thursday. Bruce Aylward, senior advisor to the WHO director-general, said the two Chinese vaccines have accounted for nearly 20 percent of total vaccines shipped through COVAX, an international COVID-19 vaccine initiative led by the WHO. Both Sinopharm and Sinovac have been validated by WHO's Emergency Use Listing in 2021. Official figures show that COVAX has shipped 959 million doses to 144 countries.
