A massive volcanic eruption in Tonga that triggered tsunami waves around the Pacific caused "significant damage" to the island nation's capital and covered it in dust. Zhao Yongming, an employee at China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation in Tonga, describes what he saw in Nuku'alofa, Tonga after the volcanic eruption. Zhao said the volcanic ash is severe, but the employee of the Chinese Company are safe. He added that the supermarkets in the country are in normal operation. Zhao can communicate with the colleagues back home through the satellite phones.
