The U.S. State Department has condemned the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's (DPRK) latest missile tests, after the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the Republic of Korea claimed two projectiles were launched from the DPRK's coastal city of Hamhung on Thursday morning. Washington says the launches violated multiple UN Security Council resolutions and brought threats to other countries. The projectiles are presumed to be short-range ballistic missiles, and this is the sixth such launch this year. The DPRK said it conducted four missile tests earlier this month, including hypersonic missiles and tactical guided missiles.
