CGTN's Winter Olympics-themed production One Dream will be broadcast on January 22.  One Dream, a 60-minute feature accompanied by a series of short videos, follows six young aspiring Olympians – figure skaters, hockey players and speed skaters – from China and Canada, as they learn about each other's culture and lifestyle and discover they are united by the shared goal of one day competing together on the global stage. Here is the first set of posters for One Dream, which contain three sports setting the scene for Beijing 2022: figure skating, short track speed skating and ice hockey.
