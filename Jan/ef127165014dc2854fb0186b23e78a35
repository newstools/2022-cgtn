A state of emergency has been declared in Tonga after a massive undersea volcano erupted on Monday. The quake was felt as far away as Fiji, 750 kilometers from Tonga. Li Peng, a Chinese in Fiji's capital Suva, said he had lost contact with friends in Tonga. Regarding posts online that "volcanic ash blocks the sky," "you can smell the sour taste" and people are "out of breath" in Fiji, Li said he did not feel so, but still worried about the situation in Tonga.
