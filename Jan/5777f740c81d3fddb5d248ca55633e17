Tap water in Tonga's capital Nuku'alofa is currently only used for washing and cannot be directly consumed, as the degree of pollution is not clear, a China Media Group reporter said on Friday. A Chinese national working in Tonga added that bottled water is now the main source of drinking water. Electricity was restored in the capital city, located on Tongatapu Island, as of Friday noon local time.
