The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has confirmed that it conducted a hypersonic missile test launch into the sea on Wednesday, according to the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA). The missile successfully traveled 435 miles (700 km) to hit its target, making a 75 mile (120 km) lateral maneuver along the way, the KCNA reported Thursday morning. "In the test launch, the academy reconfirmed the flight control and stability of the missile in the active-flight stage and assessed the performance of the new lateral movement technique applied to the detached hypersonic gliding warhead," the report said. The agency did not provide further details about the location of the test. The Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the Republic of Korea (ROK) said in a statement on Wednesday morning that the DPRK had fired an unidentified projectile toward the East Sea from the DPRK's inland area at about 8:10 a.m. local time. China on Wednesday urged all relevant parties to cherish the "hard-won" peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.
