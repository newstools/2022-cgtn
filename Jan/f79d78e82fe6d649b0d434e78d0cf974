Manchester City's seemingly unstoppable charge to the Premier League title slowed slightly as they were held to a 1-1 draw at Southampton on Saturday, snapping a 12-match winning sequence that had distanced their rivals. Manchester United moved into the top four of the Premier League with a last second goal from Marcus Rashford earning them a 1-0 win over West Ham United at Old Trafford. Everton began life after Rafa Benitez in much the same manner as they ended it in a 1-0 loss at home to Aston Villa leaving them in 16th place, just four points above the relegation zone. Newcastle United claimed only their second league win of the season as they beat Leeds United 1-0 away, boosting their hopes of beating the drop. Wolverhampton Wanderers won 2-1 at Brentford where the match was halted because of a drone flying above the ground. City were stunned after seven minutes at St Mary's as Kyle Walker-Peters struck his first Premier League goal, a stunning effort with the outside of his right foot. It knocked Pep Guardiola's side out of their silky stride and it took a 65th-minute header by Aymeric Laporte to earn them a second draw of the season against Southampton. Kevin de Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Rodri all hit the woodwork for City as they extended their lead at the top to 12 points, although second-placed Liverpool have played two games less. "I don't understand the way people say that now, after this result, the race is open, when before it is over," said Guardiola, whose side have 57 points. "I would love to be 40 points ahead of Liverpool and Chelsea, but that's impossible. I would never expect to be in this position, with this margin."
