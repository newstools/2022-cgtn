The referendum on amendment of the Belarusian Constitution has been scheduled for February 27, according to a decree signed by Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko on Thursday. The central election commission will organize the referendum, sum up its results and observe the enforcement of the appropriate legislation. The draft constitution was presented for a nationwide discussion on December 27, 2021, which expands powers of the All-Belarusian People's Assembly, and removes the "non-nuclear" and "neutral" clauses.
