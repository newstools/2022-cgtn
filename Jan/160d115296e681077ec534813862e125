Russia's Gazprom has rejected Moldova's request to reschedule its January gas payment, forcing the country to face a state of emergency in its energy sector, the government said on Wednesday. Deputy Prime Minister Andrei Spinu said the country was able to pay $38 million out of a total bill of $63 million. However, the government said it would ask the parliament on Thursday to introduce the state of emergency. Moldova and Gazprom agreed on a five-year contract that began on November 1 with a monthly prepayment date of the 20th day of each month.
