Sudanese security forces fired tear gas on Sunday at protesters heading toward the presidential palace in the capital Khartoum and neighboring city Omdurman, AFP reported citing witnesses. Demonstrations were frequently staged in Sudan since the military takeover last October as protesters demanding civilian rule. "No, no to military rule," the demonstrators chanted as they waved the national flag. (With input from AFP)
