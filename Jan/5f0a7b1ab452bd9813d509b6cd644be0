In the 21st century, we will see the end of the era of Western domination of world history, a return to success of many Asian societies, and a small, densely interconnected global village. This is the idea put forward by Professor Kishore Mahbubani in his new book The Asian 21st Century. As a former senior diplomat of Singapore and a renowned scholar of geopolitics, Mahbubani offers a comprehensive and in-depth study of the global dynamics and challenges, as well as concrete solutions for restoring international governance. To explore the topics of his new book, we're honored to have Prof. Kishore Mahbubani on the show. We'll also be joined in the discussion by Wang Huiyao, President of the Center for China and Globalization.
