The organizer of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the world's largest technology show, said on Thursday it was unable for them to confirm the number of COVID-19 cases from the in-person event in Las Vegas last week after South Korean authorities said about 70 attendees from the country tested positive for the coronavirus. The 70 South Korean nationals included representatives from Samsung Electronics and chipmaker SK Hynix, according to Reuters. Of the 40,000 that attended CES, 30 percent traveled from outside the United States, the organizer, the Consumer Technology Association, reported. The show, which took place both online and offline January 5-7, went ahead despite major companies including General Motors and Amazon canceling their in-person attendance as Omicron cases surged across the globe. "Results from testing done onsite by medical staff were reported to the local Southern Nevada Health Authorities," the association said. The Nevada Department of Health and Human Services did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Read more: Google, Lenovo join Consumer Electronics Show exodus
