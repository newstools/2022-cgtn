Terrorists killed two people and kidnapped 20 children in Nigeria's Borno state on Thursday, according to AFP, citing a community leader and two residents. Fighters from the terrorist group Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) stormed Piyemi village near Chibok town on Thursday afternoon, killing two men and seizing 13 girls and seven boys, according to the residents and the community leader. "They shot dead two people and took away 13 girls and seven boys aged between 12 and 15," resident Samson Bulus told AFP. The 20 kidnapped children were shoved into a truck and driven into the forest, resident Silas John told AFP. Nigerian authorities haven't yet made an official comment on the incident. In April 2014, Boko Haram kidnapped over 200 schoolgirls in Chibok. Over 100 of them have since been freed or managed to escape. (With input from AFP)
