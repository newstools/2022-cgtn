China launched a Long March-4C rocket to place a new satellite in space on Wednesday. The rocket blasted off at 7:44 a.m. at the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China and soon sent L-SAR 01A satellite into preset orbit. The satellite will be used to monitor the geological environment, landslides and earthquakes. The mission marked the 407th flight of the Long March carrier rockets, said the launch center.
