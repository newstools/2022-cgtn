Russian President Vladimir Putin and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron had a lengthy telephone conversation, with focus on providing Russia with long-term, legally secured security guarantees, the Kremlin said in a statement on Friday. The United States' and NATO's responses to Russian proposals on security did not address Moscow's principal concerns, read the statement. "The U.S. and NATO responses did not take into account Russia's fundamental concerns including preventing NATO's expansion and refusing to deploy strike weapons systems near Russia's borders," it said. The Elysee Palace on Wednesday hailed as a "positive signal" talks in Paris between Russia and Ukraine, as well as France and Germany, which produced the first joint written statement on the conflict in eastern Ukraine which was signed by Moscow and Kiev since 2019.
