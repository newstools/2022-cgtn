The early spring tea harvest season is in full swing in Liupanshui City of southwest China's Guizhou Province, and farmers have been plucking tea sprouts in anticipation of strong sales. At a spring tea garden in Shuicheng District, farmers have been busy picking fresh tea leaves as the harvest for this year's first early spring tea unfolds. "We estimate that we will harvest over 2,000 kilograms of tea sprouts and get more than 500 kilograms of dried tea," said Xie Kunlin, deputy general manager of a local tea company. The tea-growing in Liupanshui City is mainly green tea. Early spring tea is rich in amino acids and has a smooth and delicate taste. Despite its high price, locally-produced early spring tea is very popular in tea markets around the globe. "This year, we have cooperated with tea companies in Shuicheng District to buy about 4,000 kilograms of tea worth over 4 million yuan (about $629,000). Early spring tea produced in Shuicheng District is very popular across the country," said Shen Libin, a buyer. Data shows that in 2021, Shuicheng District alone harvested 192.56 tonnes of tea sprouts and processed 40.56 tonnes of dried tea worth $10.2 million. Many locals have started planting tea, and also running tourism and tea-related businesses.
