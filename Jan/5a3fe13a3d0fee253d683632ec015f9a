Three children and more than 60 adults are reported to have been killed in an overnight air strike in Yemen, a statement from Save the Children said on Friday, without providing further details. An air strike had hit a temporary detention center in Yemen's Saada Province earlier in the day, killing several people including African migrants, according to a Reuters witness. The Saudi-led coalition is stepping up operations on areas held by the Houthi movement.
