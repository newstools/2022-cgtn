The population of endangered Asian elephants in Yunnan Province of southwest China has grown steadily over the past 30 years from 150 to more than 300, thanks to conservation measures. Months ago, a herd of wandering wild Asian elephants in the province caught global attention on a 17-month journey from their forest home in Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, which ended on August 8, 2021, when they finally returned to the nature reserve where they first set out. The Asian elephant is listed as "endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. It is under first-class state protection in China. Now the Asian elephant population in Yunnan is growing continuously under the protection of local authorities and people.
