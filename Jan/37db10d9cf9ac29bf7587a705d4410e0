Germany officially assumed the presidency of the Group of Seven (G7) on Saturday and vowed to focus on major issues, with climate policy as the top priority. Germany will use its presidency of the G7 to assist with the global economic recovery and strengthen climate protection initiatives, said German Finance Minister Christian Lindner on Saturday. Lindner recently replaced Chancellor Olaf Scholz atop Germany's Finance Ministry. Germany wants to use its G7 presidency to develop it into a club that is pioneering in its efforts to achieve green growth and a socially just world, Scholz said in his first New Year's address.
