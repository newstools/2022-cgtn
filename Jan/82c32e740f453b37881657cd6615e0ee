The medals for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games have been unveiled. The medals are called "Tongxin," meaning "together as one," and feature five concentric rings embodying the traditional Chinese philosophy of harmony between heaven, earth and human beings. The rings also symbolize the Olympic rings, carved in the inner circle, and the Olympic spirit uniting the world through sports.
