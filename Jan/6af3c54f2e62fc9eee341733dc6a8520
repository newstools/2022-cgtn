China has urged the United States to "find no more excuses and immediately correct the wrongdoings" in its trade practices after a World Trade Organization (WTO) ruling granted China rights to slap tariffs on U.S. goods, according to the Ministry of Commerce on Thursday. The WTO authorized China on Wednesday to slap duties on U.S. imports worth $645 million annually, as the U.S. failed to implement previous recommendations and rulings made by the WTO Dispute Settlement Body. China went to the WTO in 2012 to challenge countervailing duties the United States imposed between 2008 and 2012, mainly during the term of former U.S. President Barack Obama, on 22 Chinese products, including paper, solar panels and steel wire. "The ruling is of great significance in rectifying U.S. countervailing duties on imported Chinese goods, protecting the legitimate trade interests of Chinese companies and safeguarding multilateral trading systems," the Commerce Ministry said. It is the second time China has been granted rights to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports from the United States, the ministry said.
