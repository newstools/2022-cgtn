A stampede at a Christian prayer gathering in Liberia's capital Monrovia has killed at least 29 people, police said on Thursday, adding that the death toll may rise. Police spokesperson Moses Carter told AFP the death toll was provisional and "may increase" because a number of people were in critical condition. He said children were among the dead.
