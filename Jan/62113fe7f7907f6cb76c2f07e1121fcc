China stamped a ticket to the 2023 FIFA Women's World Cup by defeating Vietnam 3-1 in the quarterfinal match of the 2022 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Women's Asian Cup at DY Patil Stadium on Sunday. The top five teams in the Asian Cup will be granted automatic qualification for the World Cup next year in Australia. The win also advanced China to the semifinal round of the Asian Cup tournament. Though China won all of their previous 10 games against Vietnam, the Southeast Asian force caught the Steel Roses off guard to score first in the 11th minute. Yang Lina's poor clear was cut before Nguyen Thi Tuyet Dung broke China's net, giving Vietnam a 1-0 lead. It took the Chinese national team about 14 minutes to calm down, find their pace and rally. In the 25th minute, Wang Shanshan's shot in the box was rejected by the goalkeeper, but she appeared in the right place at the right time, scoring to tie the game with a smart push. It was her her fifth goal of the tournament, and she has scored in all three of China's games. Piece by piece, China regained control of the pitch and began to create more threats against Vietnam's goal. Having finished the first half, China led in shooting attempts (8-3), shots on target and ball possession (72 percent–28 percent). China's second and third goals came one minute into the second half. First, Wang Shuang assisted Wang Shanshan to score on a crossover from right in the 52nd minute. Then Wang Shuang again pierced the opponents' defensive line with a through ball to Tang Jiali. Tang paused to dodge the defender and then blasted the ball into the top right corner of the goal, extending China's lead to 3-1. Vietnam had the chance to cut their deficit in the 87th minute, but Nguyen Thi Bich Thuy's penalty kick was denied by the bar. China's will face Japan in the semifinals on February 3. Japan beat Thailand 7-0 in the quarterfinal match earlier on Sunday.
