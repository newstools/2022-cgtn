The U.S. Justice Department on Thursday dropped its case against Chen Gang, a Chinese American professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) who was accused of hiding his ties to China when seeking U.S. federal grant money. The Chinese-born nanotechnologist was charged last year with wire fraud, failing to file a foreign bank account report, and making a false statement on his tax returns.
