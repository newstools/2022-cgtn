Japan and Australia signed a treaty on Thursday that strengthens defense and security cooperation between the two countries, AFP has reported. When asked at a regular briefing on Wednesday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said cooperation between countries should enhance understanding and trust in the region, not target or undermine the interests of any third party. "The Pacific Ocean is vast enough for the common development of countries in the region. Peace and stability depend on the joint efforts of countries in the region. We hope that the Pacific will be an ocean of peace, not a place to make waves." Wang said.
