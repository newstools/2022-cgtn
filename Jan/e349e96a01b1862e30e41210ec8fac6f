China said on Wednesday that it welcomes comments by Lithuania's president that it was a "mistake" for the European country to open a "representative office" under the name Taiwan. "The name of the office has become the key factor that now strongly affects our relations with China," Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda told a local radio station, adding that the office name was not "coordinated" with him. The office under the name of China's Taiwan region was opened in Vilnius in November, which immediately prompted a backlash from China. Beijing believes the decision was an outright violation of the one-China principle. "It is correct to recognize this mistake, but what is most important is to take action in correcting this act of creating 'one China and one Taiwan' and return to the one-China principle," said Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Wenbin at a regular press conference on Wednesday. "We also warn Taiwan's authorities that any attempt at seeking 'Taiwan independence' is doomed to fail," he added. (Cover: The Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, Taiwan, China. /Xinhua)
