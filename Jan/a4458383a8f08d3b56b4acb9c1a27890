It took the 35-year-old Spanish super star more than five hours to beat 25-year-old Medvedev; Game 6 of the third set lasted for over 12 minutes. This was the second longest final in the tournament history, only behind Nadal's loss to Djokovic in 2012. With this win, Nadal became the fourth men's singles player to win all of the four Grand Slam majors at least twice. He waited 13 years to lift the Australian Open trophy again since he did it for the first time in 2009.
