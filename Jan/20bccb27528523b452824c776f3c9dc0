The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is a unique model of bilateral cooperation that is based on friendship and aims to improve people's livelihoods and promote regional peace, said Pakistani President Arif Alvi during an interview on Friday. As all-weather strategic cooperative partners, China and Pakistan have supported each other no matter how the situation in the world has evolved and set a fine example of bilateral relations over the past seven decades, the president added.
