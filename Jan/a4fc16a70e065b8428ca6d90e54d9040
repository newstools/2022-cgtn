The office of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has apologized to the Queen after reports revealed two staff parties took place at Downing Street the day before Prince Philip's funeral. Reports say Johnson's staff partied in Downing Street and his residence last April, even as Queen Elizabeth mourned her late husband. At the time, mixing indoors was banned for people from different households. It was also a period of national mourning over Philip's death.
