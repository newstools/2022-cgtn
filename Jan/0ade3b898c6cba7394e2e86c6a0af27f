China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Thursday that China hopes the situation in Kazakhstan will stabilize as soon as possible and return social order back to the right direction. Speaking at a regular press briefing, Wang said China believes the government of Kazakhstan will properly handle the protests, which is an internal affair of Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan has seen escalating unrest in recent days following the lifting of price caps on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), a popular car fuel, causing consumer prices to surge. The demonstrations quickly spread to other parts surrounding the oil-producing Mangystau Province and the country's largest city, Almaty. An official from Kazakhstan's health ministry told local media on Thursday that several hundred people were wounded. "More than 1,000 people were wounded following riots in different regions of Kazakhstan. Nearly 400 among them were hospitalized, and 62 people are in intensive care," Deputy Health Minister Azhar Guiniyat said.
