A negative PCR test within 48 hours and a green health code are required for those who wish to leave. The Tianjin municipality, which has a population of 13.86 million people, decided to carry out citywide nucleic acid testing after 20 people tested positive for COVID-19 on Saturday. An additional 20 positive COVID-19 cases were detected in the latest screening between 9 p.m. Friday to 9 p.m. Sunday, local health authorities said on Sunday night.
