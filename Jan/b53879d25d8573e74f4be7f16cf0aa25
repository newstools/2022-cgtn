The Chinese Defense Ministry on Thursday warned the United States and Japan against interfering in the Taiwan question. In a recent virtual meeting, the U.S. and Japanese foreign and defense ministers accused China of undermining the "rules-based international order" and posing challenges to the region and the world. In response, Wu Qian, spokesperson for the Chinese Defense Ministry, said the U.S. and Japan interfered in China's internal affairs and fabricated fake information to smear China. "The Chinese side expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to this, and has raised serious representations to the countries concerned," the spokesperson said. He reiterated that "the one and only rule of the world should not be based on interests of 'small circles'" and that "the one and only order of the world is not the selfish order advocated by a very few countries." Wu said the international community should be vigilant to the insistence on a cold war mentality by the United States and Japan, adding that the two countries have strengthened their military presence in the East China Sea and the South China Sea, and carried out highly targeted military provocations. The spokesperson said the root cause of the current tensions in the Taiwan Straits was the "continuous provocations" by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority and the "Taiwan independence" separatists in collusion with external forces. He added that the U.S. and Japan were fueling the DPP authority to seek "Taiwan independence" and sending "wrong signals" to the "Taiwan independence" separatists. "That is the biggest threat to peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits." Wu added that the People's Liberation Army has a "rock-solid determination and growing capabilities to defend China's national sovereignty and territorial integrity."
