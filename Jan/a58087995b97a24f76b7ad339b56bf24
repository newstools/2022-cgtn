An 85,600-tonne super large bulk carrier independently developed and built by China was delivered in Guangzhou City of south China's Guangdong Province on Monday. The delivered ship has been rented by a major shipping company in the United States, mainly for shipping soybeans, corn and other cereals. So far, eight orders have been placed for the carrier as large ships are increasingly needed for long-distance shipping.
