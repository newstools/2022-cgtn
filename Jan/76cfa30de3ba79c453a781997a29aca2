Christmas Eve was a nightmare of sorts for U.S. retailer Walmart and its membership store Sam's Club, in China. No: the retailer was not swamped with tons of orders, or customers flocking to buy goods at the brick-and-mortar outlets. Instead, it was facing a barrage of criticisms from customers in China, for removing Xinjiang products from the Sam's Club online app based on groundless accusations. In this episode of BizBeat, CGTN's Song Yaotian points out removing Xinjiang products is akin to the U.S. biting the hand that feeds it.
