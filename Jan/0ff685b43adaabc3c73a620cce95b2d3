The water in several salt lakes in Yuncheng City of north China's Shanxi Province turned hot pink on Wednesday. The vivid color is produced by a micro-algae named Dunaliella salina, which can produce elements including carotene that looks red. This algae usually grows in salt lakes because it is a halophile, a "salt-loving" organism. (All images via CFP.)
