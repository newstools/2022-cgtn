China shipped relief supplies worth 1 million yuan ($157,900) on Monday from Fiji to Tonga, which has suffered heavy damage from the recent volcanic eruption and tsunami. A departure ceremony was held at a port in Suva's Walu Bay to see off two vessels of China National Fisheries (Group) Corporation carrying the urgent supplies. According to Chinese Ambassador to Fiji Qian Bo, most of the relief supplies, including drinking water, food, electric generators, water pumps, electric saws, personnel protective equipment and medical supplies, have been raised by the Chinese Embassy in Fiji and the remaining donated by the Chinese enterprises in Fiji. China and Tonga are comprehensive strategic partners. If the countries in the South Pacific region need assistance, China is always ready to provide support within its capacity, said Qian. With the help of the international community, the ambassador believed that Tonga will surely recover from the disaster and the Tongans will rebuild their homeland. It will take about three days for the two fishing ships with 18 crew members to reach Tonga, according to Cao Yongjun, a representative for China National Fisheries (Group) Fiji Corporation. The relief supplies through the Embassy of Fiji were among the latest three batches of aid China pledged to Tonga, China's Foreign Ministry said on Monday. China will also provide another batch of emergency relief material worth 20 million yuan ($3.158 million) and humanitarian aid in cash to Tonga. Previously, the Red Cross Society of China (RCSC) has already provided $100,000 towards relief efforts in Tonga. Tsunami waves hit Tonga on January 15 following a massive underwater volcanic eruption. The tsunami had a significant impact on part of the foreshore of Tonga, with boats and large boulders washed ashore and shops along the coast damaged.
