Visiting Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday announced that China will provide another 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to Kenya, saying China will continue to stand firmly with its brothers and sisters in Africa to defeat the pandemic. Wang made the remarks during a joint press conference with Kenya's Cabinet Secretary for Foreign Affairs, Raychelle Omamo in Kenya's port city Mombasa. Kenya is the second stop of Wang's three-nation tour in Africa. China has a 32-year-old diplomatic tradition of making Africa the first destination of its New Year's diplomatic activities, Wang said, adding that China cherishes its traditional friendship with Africa, insists on making Africa a priority of China's diplomacy and is willing to be a good friend and partner to Africa. Noting that the world is experiencing a wave of new Omicron infections, the Chinese foreign minister said China, as a friend of Africa, will not stand by and is willing to work with Africa to completely defeat the pandemic. According to Wang, China signed numerous partnership projects with Kenya. He said China is willing to support Kenya to accelerate industrialization. He also told reporters that China will appoint a special envoy to the Horn of Africa to support efforts to overcome security challenges and ensure the region's long peace and prosperity. The Horn of Africa enjoys a unique geographical location and has great development potential. However, it has suffered from regional conflicts and occasional confrontations in recent years, Wang said, adding that such a situation cannot continue indefinitely. Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta on Thursday also met with Wang. They jointly inspected the Kipevu Kenya Oil terminus (KOT) at the port of Mombasa, a project undertaken by Chinese enterprise.
