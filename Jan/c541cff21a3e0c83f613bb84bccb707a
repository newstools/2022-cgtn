Army rescuers cleared routes around a Pakistani hilltop town sheltering thousands of tourists on Sunday, after 22 people died in vehicles trapped by heavy snow. The resort town of Murree, around 70 kilometres northeast of Islamabad, was inundated with tourists and day trippers last week after unusually heavy snow turned it into a winter wonderland.  But a blizzard from Friday onward felled trees and blocked narrow roads leading in and out of the town.
