The Polish government has signed deals with several local companies to build a wall along its border with Belarus, Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Wasik announced on Tuesday. The barrier is being built based on a law on border security that came into force last October and it consists of 5-metre tall steel posts with barbed wire on top, stretching over 186 kilometers.
