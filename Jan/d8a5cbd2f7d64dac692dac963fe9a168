A mainland spokesperson on Tuesday slammed Taiwan authorities for interfering in Hong Kong issues, calling for a stop to "Hong Kong independence" forces. Some Taiwan authorities have attacked and smeared the principle of "One Country, Two Systems," said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, after the shutdown of anti-China news platform Stand News. "We firmly support the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region to deal with certain cases based on legislations. No one has the right to interfere," she pointed out. The Hong Kong situation has returned to the right track as the "One Country, Two Systems" principle has shown great vitality and prospect, she added, warning Taiwan authorities to stay out of the matter.
