At least six people were killed and eight others injured in multiple airstrikes launched by the Saudi-led coalition on Yemeni capital Sanaa on Monday night, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV reported. The airstrikes targeted the First Armored Division camp in the central part of Sanaa, it said without providing further details. The coalition said that its airstrikes came shortly after Houthi forces claimed responsibility for drone attacks on the airport and oil tankers in the United Arab Emirates.
