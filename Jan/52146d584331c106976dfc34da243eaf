Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a press conference that China has expressed its serious concern and dissatisfaction with the U.S. consideration to withdraw its diplomats to avoid subjecting them to COVID-19 control measures. Zhao stressed that China's pandemic control measures are in line with the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. "China is undoubtedly the safest country in the world at the moment, and withdrawing from the safest place will only greatly increase the risk of infection for U.S. personnel. The logic of the U.S. side's decision is incomprehensible and difficult to justify," he added.
