Seven people have been killed in Sudan after security forces used gunfire and tear gas on Monday to disperse protests against military rule. It's one of the deadliest rallies in the capital Khartoum since the army's takeover on October 25 and comes ahead of a visit by U.S. diplomats to broker an end to the months-long crisis. Protesters have regularly taken to the streets since the takeover, despite a security clampdown.
