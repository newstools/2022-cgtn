At least 13 people, including four minors, were killed and 10 others injured when a passenger van crashed in the central Mexican state of Jalisco on Saturday, officials said. The vehicle was transporting tourist personnel when it overturned on the Leon-Aguascalientes highway in the municipality of Lagos de Moreno, the Jalisco Civil Protection and Fire Department said. A preliminary investigation found the driver lost control of the van and it rolled over on the highway before eventually toppling onto its side in a deep run along the highway.
