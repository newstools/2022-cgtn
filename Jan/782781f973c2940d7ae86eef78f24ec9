Tensions continue to ratchet up in Kazakhstan. Demonstrators stormed and set on fire the presidential residence and the mayor's office in the country's largest city Almaty. Police officers reportedly fired at some protesters at the residence and used water cannons, tear gas and stun grenades to disperse crowds. Authorities said eight police officers and national guard members were killed and more than 300 were injured on Wednesday. So far, there are no figures on civilian casualties. A nationwide two-week state of emergency has been declared. The government has resigned amid the crisis. The widespread protests were initially triggered by the fuel price hikes. President Kassym-Jomart Tokayevhas called the unrest a "terrorist threat" and appealed for international assistance.
