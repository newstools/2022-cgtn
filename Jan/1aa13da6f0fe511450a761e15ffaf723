At least seven people have died and nine others were seriously injured when a wall of rock collapsed on top of motorboats below a waterfall in southeastern Brazil on Saturday, the fire department said. The tower of rock broke away without warning from the canyon wall and crashed into Furnas Lake near Capitolio in Minas Gerais state. Videos posted on social media showed tourists shouting as the column of rock smashed into the water. At least one wrecked boat sank, while others sped away. Authorities said three people were still missing after others feared lost were located by telephone. Divers searched the lake. The people hurt in the accident had broken bones and one was in serious condition in hospital with head and facial injuries. Some 23 others were treated for light injuries, a fire department official said. The region has been under heavy rainfall for two weeks, which could have loosened the rock face. On Saturday, a dike overflowed at an iron ore mine 300 kilometers to the east, cutting off a major federal highway.
