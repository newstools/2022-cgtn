The man who took four people hostage at a Texas synagogue is "deceased," the police chief said Saturday after the captives were rescued unharmed. "The hostage rescue team breached the synagogue," Colleyville police chief Michael Miller told a news conference. "The suspect is deceased," he said. Governor Texas Greg Abbott said earlier all the people taken hostage were released safely. "Prayers answered. All hostages are out alive and safe," Abbott said on Twitter, more than 10 hours after four people were taken hostage at Congregation Beth Israel. Hostage negotiators were locked in a tense standoff at a Texas synagogue on Saturday where a man apparently demanding the release of a convicted terrorist had taken several captives, police and media said. One male hostage was released uninjured earlier, shortly after 5:00 p.m., the Colleyville police department said in a statement. The police said it had evacuated residents from the area around Congregation Beth Israel and deployed SWAT teams after responding to an emergency call at 10:41 a.m. about a disturbance during a religious service. Media reports said the suspect had taken a rabbi and at least three others hostage at the Congregation Beth Israel, and the hostage-taker was armed and had claimed to have bombs in unknown locations. Abbot said earlier the man was demanding to speak with or see a woman serving a prison sentence in a federal prison.
