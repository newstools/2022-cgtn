The starting-lineups of this season's NBA All-Star Game have been confirmed, but not completely because the captains of both sides, LeBron James and Kevin Durant, may miss the entertaining mid-season event due to injury. Before their replacements can be found, the rest of the squads have been questioned as well. For example, many don't think Andrew Wiggins can be a legit All-Star starter; and the leading teams of the Western and Eastern Conference, the Phoenix Suns and Miami Heat, had no one make the starting-lineups. The All-Star reserves will be named by the head coaches of the two teams on February 3. Host: Li Xiang Guest: Matthew Watson Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
