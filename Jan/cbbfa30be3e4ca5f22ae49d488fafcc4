The Chinese mainland vowed on Wednesday to smash "Taiwan independence" attempts and pledged to promote peaceful cross-Strait relations. "We will resolutely smash any 'Taiwan independence' attempt and firmly contain the interference from external forces," Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, told a press conference. The Chinese mainland will continue to promote exchanges, deepen integration and strengthen the solidarity of compatriots across the Taiwan Strait to build a better future, Zhu continued. She also urged the DPP authorities to remove the restrictions prohibiting mainland residents from visiting Taiwan and stop interfering in people-to-people exchanges across the Taiwan Strait.
