The NFL playoffs continued to bear more surprises after two days of competitions in the Conference Divisional round games.The San Francisco 49ers knocked out the National Football Conference (NFC) top-seed Green Bay Packers to challenge the Los Angeles Rams, which eliminated the reigning Super Bowl champions Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The young Cincinnati Bengals managed to beat the American Football Conference (AFC) leader Tennessee Leaders. Their opponents in the AFC Championship Game will be the Kansas City Chiefs, who edged over the Buffalo Bills in overtime after many crazy offensive moments. All four teams will have great stories to tell if they move forward in the postseason. Jimmy Garoppolo has not passed for even one touchdown despite the two wins the 49ers secured; Matthew Stafford has finally tasted victory in the playoffs in his 13th season in the league, and the Rams want to play Super Bowl at home. Joe Burrow gave the Bengals their first postseason win in over 30 years, and there's no reason for him to stop now. Patrick Mahomes lost in Super Bowl last year, and he has every reason to try to go there again and prove himself for the Chiefs.
