As Beijing 2022 approaches, athletes are fine-tuning their performance. What does sport mean to them? How has COVID-19 influenced their careers? Meagan Duhamel is a three-time Olympic medalist who started figure skating as a child. Duhamel says that sport is the athletes' livelihood, but COVID-19 took many competitions away. She hopes the competitors can get a nice prize at the end of all of this trouble that they've been going through. Duhamel also says that being able to hold two Olympic Games during this pandemic – the one in Tokyo and the upcoming one in Beijing – is giving the world hope, and that the incredible athletes are making people more aware of what friendly and peaceful competition can bring.
