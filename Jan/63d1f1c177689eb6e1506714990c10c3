Over the past 30 years, China has provided some 50,000 military personnel for UN peacekeeping missions. They have been sent to more than 20 countries, in Asia, Africa and the Middle East. Currently, China not only has more peacekeeping troops deployed than any other permanent member of the security council, but also contributes 15% of the UN's peacekeeping budget. All this represents the fulfilment of the promise made by President Xi, that "China will stay committed to the path of peaceful development and always be a builder of world peace".
