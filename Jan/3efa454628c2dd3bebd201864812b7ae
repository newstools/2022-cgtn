The Taliban-run administration has announced it will reopen the state-run universities in Afghanistan, Acting Minister of Higher Education Shiekh Abdul Baqi Haqqani said. In a video posted by Deputy Spokesman of the Administration Bilal Karimi on his Twitter account on Monday, Shiekh Abdul Baqi Haqqani said that the public universities in warmer provinces would be reopened on February 2 and in the colder areas would reopen on February 26. Since the Taliban's takeover Afghanistan on August 15, all state-run universities have remained closed. However, neither the acting education minister Haqqani nor Karimi made it clear if girls can attend the universities. So far, the Taliban government has reopened high schools for boys only in most parts of the country. A number of private universities have also reopened. Government officials have promised that girls from all grades can go to school in the new education year, which begins on March 21. (With input from Xinhua)
