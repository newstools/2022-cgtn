Iranian diplomats have arrived in Saudi Arabia to reopen Iran's representative office to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The office was closed six years ago following a diplomatic rift. Tehran says it's also ready to reopen its embassy in the Kingdom, but it depends on practical efforts by Riyadh. The two countries cut ties in 2016 when angry protesters attacked Saudi diplomatic missions in Iran after Riyadh executed a renowned Shia cleric. Saudi Arabia responded by cutting ties with Tehran and OIC foreign ministers condemned the violence.
