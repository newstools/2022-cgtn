Furthermore, the retail sales of new energy vehicles in the Chinese market reached 2.989 million in 2021 with a 169.1 percent year-on-year increase, according to a data released by the China Passenger Car Information Association (CPCA) on Tuesday.

Cui Dongshu, the secretary general of CPCA, said that the strongly differentiated features between NEVs and traditional fuel vehicles showed the change in consumer demand, with the large increase in the scale of the new energy industry chain and the subsidies for purchasing NEVs, sales are expected to see another strong increase in 2022.
