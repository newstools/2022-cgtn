At least 16 Islamic State group fighters were killed in a Kurdish-run prison in northeastern Syria, a war monitor said Friday. "At least 16 IS fighters were killed by Kurdish security forces inside the prison and in its vicinity," said Rami Abdul Rahman, the head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, after the monitor said at least 18 Kurdish security forces had been killed in the clashes.
