An Albany City Court judge on Friday dismissed the only criminal charge filed over the sexual harassment allegations that drove former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo from office. "This court is acutely aware that the fact that the district attorney's office has unfettered discretion to determine whether to prosecute a particular suspect or case, and that superior courts have long and consistently held that courts may not and should not interfere with the discretion of a district attorney," said the court Judge Holly Trexler.
