The Collective Security Treaty Organization's (CSTO) peacekeeping forces guarding socially-significant objects have begun the transfer process to Kazakhstan's law enforcement agencies, RIA news agency reported on Thursday. After protests in cities across the country, the CSTO answered Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev's appeal last week for help by sending in 2,500 peacekeeping troops from Russia and other members of a regional security organization. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed victory in defending Kazakhstan from what he described as a foreign-backed terrorist uprising, and promised leaders of other ex-Soviet states that a Moscow-led alliance would protect them. Tokayev said on Tuesday the CSTO's main mission had been successfully completed. It would start a phased withdrawal in two days and pull out altogether within 10 days. In a video call with parliament after putting down what he has called an attempted coup, Tokayev appointed a new government headed by career public servant Alikhan Smailov on Tuesday. Kazakh security forces have detained 9,900 people over the unrest, Kazakhstan's Interior Ministry said on Tuesday. (With input from Reuters)
