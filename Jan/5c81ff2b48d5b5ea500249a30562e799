Klay Thompson had a great performance for the Golden State Warriors in his first NBA game in 941 days. The dunk he made, the three triples he drained and the block he delivered in Sunday's game at home all sent one message: the other half of the "Splash Brothers" is back. One game is too small of a sample size to draw any real conclusions, but Thompson will undoubtedly play an integral role for the Warriors down the stretch, especially in their small-ball squad during clutch time.
