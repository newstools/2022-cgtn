Sudan's Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok announced his resignation from his post on Sunday in the wake of the country's political crisis. "I announce to you my resignation from the post of prime minister to make way for another person from the daughters or sons of this generous country," Hamdok said in a speech to the Sudanese people broadcast by the official Sudan TV. "You have granted me the honor to be prime minister at this delicate and hopeful circumstance, and I have tried my best to prevent our country against the danger of sliding into disaster," he said. Hamdok stressed the importance of initiating a comprehensive dialogue to end the political crisis. It is not immediately clear who will succeed Hamdok, and there seemed to be no visible candidates as the country has been experiencing a political crisis after General Commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces, Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan, declared a state of emergency on October 25 and dissolved the Sovereign Council and government. On November 21, Al-Burhan and then removed Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok signed a political declaration, which included reinstating the latter as prime minister. But the deal has so far failed to calm the street protests. Widespread discontent also fueled street protests, amid rising prices of food, gas and other household essentials in the country.
