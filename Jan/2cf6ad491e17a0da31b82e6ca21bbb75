Israeli President Isaac Herzog on Sunday said his country supports the United Arab Emirates' security needs and seeks stronger regional ties during his talk with Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. Sheikh Mohammed said the UAE and Israel share a "common view of the threats to regional stability and peace, particularly those posed by militias and terrorist forces." The two leaders discussed concerns about regional and global issues, and cooperation in multiple areas including trade and investment. Herzog arrived in the UAE for the first such official visit on Sunday morning. "Beginning the first visit by an Israeli president in the United Arab Emirates. We were delighted and deeply moved by the warm welcome in Abu Dhabi by UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan," Herzog said on Twitter. The two countries formally normalized relations in 2020.
