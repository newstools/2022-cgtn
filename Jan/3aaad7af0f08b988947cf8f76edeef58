The priority of medical facilities is to provide medical services and they cannot turn away patients for any reason, Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan said on Thursday after it was reported that a pregnant woman had lost her unborn baby amid COVID-19 restrictions that delayed her entry into a Xi'an hospital. The protection of human lives takes the utmost priority, Sun said at a meeting called to address the miscarriage episode. The treatment of patients should be classified according to their different medical needs, she said. As long as protective measures are taken, medical workers need to take in and treat critical patients right away, regardless of whether they have a COVID-19 test result or not, said Sun, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee. Designated hospitals, she said, should ensure that dialysis patients, cancer patients receiving radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as pregnant women and newborns who urgently need treatment receive continuous medical services.
