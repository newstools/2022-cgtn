Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador on Monday reiterated the asylum offer he made for Julian Assange a year ago and said he had written a letter to former U.S. President Donald Trump recommending that the WikiLeaks founder be pardoned. Mexico did not receive a reply, Lopez Obrador told a government news conference. "It would be a sign of solidarity, of fraternity to allow him asylum in the country that Assange decides to live in, including Mexico," Lopez Obrador said. If granted asylum in Mexico, Assange would not be able to interfere in the affairs of other countries and would not represent any sort of threat, Lopez Obrador added. Last month, Australian-born Assange moved closer to facing criminal charges in the United States for one of the biggest leaks of highly classified information after Washington won an appeal over his extradition in an English court. More hurdles remain before Assange could be sent to the United States after an odyssey that has taken him from teenage hacker in Melbourne to years holed up in the Ecuadorean embassy in London and then incarcerated in a maximum-security prison.
