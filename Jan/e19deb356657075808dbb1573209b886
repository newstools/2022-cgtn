Like Tokyo in summer, Beijing will also face the challenges posed by COVID-19 in hosting the Winter Olympics. What's special about Beijing 2022? And as athletes from around the world gather in Beijing with their passion for winter sports, how can the Olympic spirit help to ease political tensions? Former Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho said that people have turned to outdoor sports in greater numbers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and that China can successfully host the Winter Olympics with world audiences enjoying the events on television. He stressed the importance of sports coming first, and the example the sports community provides. He hopes that when the Olympic Games are over, at least a bit more trust will exist in the world.
