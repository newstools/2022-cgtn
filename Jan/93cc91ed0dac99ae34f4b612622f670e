The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired an unidentified ballistic missile into the eastern waters, Yonhap reported Wednesday. It was fired toward the Sea of Japan, Yonhap reported, citing the South Korean military. The Japanese government later confirmed the news, saying the DPRK launched a projectile that "appears to be a ballistic missile." The Japan Coast Guard said the unidentified projectile is believed to have already landed. It marked the DPRK's first missile test in 2022. The last test launch was conducted on October 19 when the DPRK test-fired a new type of submarine-launched ballistic missile.
