In 2021, the COVID-19 global pandemic continued to spread. Meanwhile, the 20-year Afghanistan War came to a chaotic end, leaving behind a worsening humanitarian crisis. Also, the world's great powers - China, Russia, the United States and the European Union - have seen their relations with each other range from co-existence to outright hostility. To help us take a look back at this very eventful year, we've invited Prof. Peter Kuznick from American University; Prof. John Gong from University of International Business & Economics; Russian defense analyst Pavel Felgenhauer; and Zmaryalai Abasin, correspondent in Kabul, Afghanistan.
