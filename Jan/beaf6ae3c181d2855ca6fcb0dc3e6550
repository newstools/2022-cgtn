Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have agreed on a full cessation of hostilities on the border, Sputnik reported on Friday citing the Kyrgyz border service. "During the negotiations ... the following agreements were reached: on a complete ceasefire; on the withdrawal of additional forces and means sent to the border to places of permanent deployment by each of the parties; on opening traffic on the Batken-Isfana highway; on joint patrolling border regions by law enforcement officers of Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan in order to prevent conflicts," a Kyrgyz border service spokesman was quoted as saying. Kyrgyz and Tajik border guards exchanged fire on Thursday amid a standoff over a blocked road. The fresh clash left two Tajik civilians dead and 10 others injured, of which six were servicemen and four were civilians, Tajikistan said on Friday. Early media reports said four Kyrgyz servicemen have been wounded. (With input from agencies)
