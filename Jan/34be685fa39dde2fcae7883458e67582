A recent article from an Australian media wrote that "there had been delays getting test kits past Chinese customs for no obvious reason". It seems that in the eyes of Australian media, the reason for COVID test kit shortages is not due to the country's insufficient pandemic prevention or the government procurement problems, but because of China, says CGTN's Michelle Van den Bergh. In this episode of BizBeat, Michelle points out that China not only did not obstruct any export of pandemic prevention materials, but also took the initiative to overcome its own difficulties and provide assistance to other countries within its capacity. She believes there is really no need to make everything political and blame China for Australia's inefficiency.
