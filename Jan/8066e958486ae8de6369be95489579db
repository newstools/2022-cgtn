Taiwan confirmed 11 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases on Sunday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases related to the Taoyuan International Airport cluster infections to 25, the island's disease monitoring agency said. The new confirmed cases include airport cleaners, staffers handling luggage carts, a taxi driver tasked with taking passengers to and from quarantine facilities, and the relatives of people who have contracted the disease. Given the rising number of cases originating from the airport, over 8,000 airport workers are being tested to identify potential cases that have spread to communities, the agency said. The current Level-2 COVID-19 alert, which was due to expire on Monday, will be extended for another two weeks to January 24, it noted. The face mask mandate, which was tightened in Taoyuan earlier due to locally transmitted infections identified at the airport, will now apply across the island, meaning that people must wear masks when they exercise, sing, and take photos, for instance, it said.
