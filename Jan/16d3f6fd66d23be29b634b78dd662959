A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Saturday warned that if "Taiwan independence" separatist forces continue to provoke and cross the red line, the mainland will be forced to take drastic measures. Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to a speech made by Taiwan regional leader Tsai Ing-wen. Zhu condemned the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities in Taiwan for deliberately plotting separation, provocation, and colluding with outside forces. "Realizing the complete reunification of the motherland is the common aspiration of the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits," Zhu stressed. The spokesperson also expressed wishes to strive for the prospect of peaceful reunification with utmost sincerity and efforts. "We sincerely hope that the compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits will work together and move forward together to oppose the 'Taiwan independence' attempts and manipulation by external forces," said Zhu. She called for joint efforts to maintain peace and stability in the region and promote the complete reunification of the motherland.
