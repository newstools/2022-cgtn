Chinese athletes are making a final push toward the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games which are less than a month away. On Wednesday night, the Chinese national figure skating team conducted their last public training session before the Winter Games. The team's figure skating star duo Sui Wenjing and Han Cong have geared up for the upcoming competitions. After missing the gold medal by just half a point in Pyeongchang in 2018, and overcoming various injuries, the duo have extra motivation to strive for the top glory. "We will do our best, do best as a team, and avoid possible problems. We will strive to show the best of ourselves during the games," Sui said. A big part of the nearly-two-hour-long session was invested in the practice of single-jumping. Peng Cheng of the national team said single jumping has always been a problem for her, but she's gathering experience every day to build muscle memory. "Now athletes are training three times a day, and they have extra training at night. Single jumping training has been intensified. From physical training to targeted explosive training, athletes have a specific training plan. They are trying their best," Zhao Hongbo, head coach of the national team, said.
