Zhu Hong and Li Yu, a couple living in Beijing's Shijia Hutong, create stickers with the Chinese character "福" (meaning good fortune) every year. The character signifies blessings for the Spring Festival, and the couple distributes them to their neighbors every year. Zhu has been learning calligraphy and painting since 2013. At 70, she has become a community artist in Shijia Hutong. She has even created an entire set of Chinese zodiac-based "Fu" stickers and paintings. So, how will the couple enjoy the Chinese Lunar New Year this time? Take a look with CGTN's Xu Yi.
