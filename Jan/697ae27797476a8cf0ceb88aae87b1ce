It's Day 73 out of 100 and Nadim is learning how to fight like a Peking Opera warrior. His stage character has a sword in hand and a bone to pick with his opponent. But what is supposed to be a well-choreographed scuffle is now looking pretty rough around the edges. Episode 7 of Mission 100 is all about being in sync (or lack thereof)!
