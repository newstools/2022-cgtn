The first shipment of assistance recently directed by U.S. President Joe Biden to Ukraine arrived in Ukraine Friday night, the U.S. Embassy in Kiev tweeted. This shipment, including "close to 200,000 pounds of aid," demonstrates "U.S. commitment to helping Ukraine bolster its defenses in the face of growing Russian aggression," said the embassy. It came following U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Kiev to show their support for Ukraine. The top U.S. diplomat said Washington would keep providing defense assistance to Kyiv and renewed a promise of severe sanctions against Russia in the event of a new invasion. On Saturday, German Defense Minister Christine Lambrecht also said the country will send a field hospital to Ukraine. They rejected Kiev's calls for weapons delivery once again as fears of a Russian invasion grow. "We are standing on Kiev's side. We must do everything to de-escalate the situation," Lambrecht said. "Weapons deliveries would not be helpful at the moment, and that is the consensus within the government," she added. (With input from AFP)
