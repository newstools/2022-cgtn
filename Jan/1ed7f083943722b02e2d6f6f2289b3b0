Iranian Foreign Ministry on Monday ruled out the possibility of reaching a provisional agreement between Iran and remaining parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, also known as the JCPOA, in the ongoing Vienna meetings. Tehran is "looking for a lasting and credible agreement, and no agreement without these two components is on our agenda," said ministry spokesperson Saeed Khatibzadeh.
