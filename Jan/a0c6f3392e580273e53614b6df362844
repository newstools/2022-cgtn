Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov warned on Monday that the United States and the NATO alliance could face a worsening security situation if they fail to demonstrate interest in dialogue with Russia on its expected security guarantees, the RIA news agency reported. Ryabkov's remarks came ahead of talks between Russia and the United States in Geneva on Monday amid fears over a Russian troop buildup on its border with Ukraine.
