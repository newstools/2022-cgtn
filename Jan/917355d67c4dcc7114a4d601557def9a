Kyiv's Pechersky District Court will start selecting a measure of restraint for former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on January 17, the country's national news agency Ukrinform reported on Friday, citing the press service of the State Bureau of Investigation. Poroshenko was placed under formal investigation for high treason last December and accused of links to financing separatist forces in the eastern Donbass region. Poroshenko is reportedly to return from a foreign trip to Kyiv on January 17.
