Moldova's parliament on Thursday instituted a 60-day state of emergency in the energy sector due to a possible suspension of gas supplies by Russian energy giant Gazprom. During the emergency period, the commission for emergency situations will be able to introduce rationed consumption of natural gas and other energy sources, allocate funds for the purchase of natural gas, coordinate the work of the media and take other emergency measures. "The introduction of a state of emergency is necessary for the energy security of the state, for all citizens of Moldova to spend the winter without problems and have gas," Moldovan Prime Minister Natalia Gavrilita told the parliament. She added that this was the first time that Gazprom had used a contractual provision on an advance payment, although it had been in force for several years. Moldova's largest supplier Moldovagaz previously proposed to pay only $38 million of its January bill of $63 million to Gazprom, which was rejected by the Russian company. Later on Thursday, Moldovagaz confirmed it has paid the full sum owed to Gazprom with financial assistance from the government, thereby avoiding the threat of a cutoff in supply. "Moldovagaz has fully transferred the payment for natural gas delivered in the first half of January 2022 to Gazprom," the company said in a statement. The transfer amounted to $34 billion, the company added. "This is the final tranche of the $63 million that had to be paid for this period," it said. In the previous years, Gazprom allowed Moldovagaz to accumulate negative deviations in winter and to pay them later, in the following months, according to local media reports. A state of emergency due to a gas deficit was also declared in the country sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine last autumn, when the contract with Gazprom had not been extended and Gazprom had reduced deliveries.
