The seventh-term Legislative Council (LegCo) of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Wednesday started its first meeting. Its opening session outlined the plans to set up a bureau to focus on housing issues and gave an update on the construction of the Northern Metropolis along the border with Shenzhen. CGTN's Zhu Dan said the number of government bureaus will increase from 13 to 15. The revamp includes creating a Culture and Tourism Bureau, splitting the current Transport and Housing Bureau into two separate bureaus and expanding the Innovation and Technology Bureau to cover industry. HKSAR Chief Executive Carrie Lam said the Food and Health Bureau would be renamed the Health Bureau and the Home Affairs Bureau would be transformed into the Environment and Ecology Bureau. Forty legislative proposals will also be put forward for lawmakers to handle, Lam said.
