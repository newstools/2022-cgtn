CGTN's series "The Game Makers" profiles a group of people who make tremendous contributions to the Beijing Winter Olympic Games or show their great passion for winter sports. In the 12th episode, we tell the story of Wu Nan, an inheritor of the Oroqen hunting civilization. People of the ethnic Oroqen group mainly live in the northeastern part of north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. He shared their hunting life with us and said skiing and shooting are similar to the biathlon, which is on the competition program at the upcoming Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics.
