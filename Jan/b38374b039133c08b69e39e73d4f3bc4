All Chinese citizens in Tonga are safe and sound, Chinese Ambassador to Tonga Cao Xiaolin told CMG on Thursday. Eight houses of Chinese families were destroyed in the tsunami following the volcanic eruption. The embassy provided consular protective measures to affected Chinese families, including text messaging how to be protected from volcanic ashes. The relief supplies donated by the Chinese government are the first batch of emergency relief materials received by the Tongan government after the disaster. China will continue to provide assistance to help Tonga tide over and rebuild the country, Cao said.
