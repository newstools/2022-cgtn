Mixed doubles world champions Xu Xin and Liu Shiwen were crowned during the World Table Tennis (WTT) Macao event on Saturday. Xu/Liu beat fellow Chinese Fan Zhendong/Kuai Man 11-6, 11-6, 11-5 in the mixed doubles final. "We played well throughout the game. In fact, we didn't expect to win before the game. With full preparations, we took good control of technical tactics in the final. Hopefully, we could maintain our winning style," said Liu after the match. Then Xu said his partner is "too modest." "Liu said she played well, and I think we were great. Considering the opponents' strength, we cannot win the match if we played well. So, it was great," said Xu. Also on Saturday, Wang Chuqin upset Ma Long 11-7, 11-7, 8-11, 11-8 in the men's singles quarterfinals, joining teammates Xu Xin, Xu Yingbin, and Lin Gaoyuan in the last four. In women's singles, Chen Meng will face Wang Manyu while Sun Yingsha will play Liu Shiwen. The WTT Macao is an exhibition event held between January 19 and 23, 2022 and it will not include WTT ranking points. The men's and women's singles semifinals and finals will be held on Sunday.
