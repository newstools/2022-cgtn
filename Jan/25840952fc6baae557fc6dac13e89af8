China's foreign exchange market is expected to achieve generally stable and more balanced development in 2022, said Wang Chunying, a spokesperson for the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) at a press conference on Friday. As the global economy gradually recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic, economies will normalize their fiscal and monetary policies, which will drive international trade and investment to return to normal and help stabilize China's cross-border capital flows, said Wang. Wang also said the country's efforts in all aspects will keep the economy in a reasonable range, and that the financial market will maintain a two-way opening-up with steady progress, which will create a favorable policy environment for the stable and balanced flow of cross-border funds. China's current account surplus to GDP ratio for 2021 was estimated to be within 2 percent, which was in an internationally recognized reasonable range and indicated a reasonable scale of surplus, according to Wang.
