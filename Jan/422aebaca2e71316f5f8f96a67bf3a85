Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov remarked on Saturday that Russia does not completely rule out the possibility of a meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky, according to the TASS news agency. Peskov made the comment in response to a question about whether the two leaders would meet while attending the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games next month. "There are currently no plans for such a meeting, although we cannot rule it out completely," he said. On Friday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said that Russia is ready to receive President Zelensky to discuss normalizing bilateral relations, but not the situation in the Donbass region.
