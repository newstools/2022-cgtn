Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear declared a state of emergency on Saturday due to a severe weather system "generating heavy rain, thunderstorms, tornadoes, hail and strong straight-line winds impacting much of Western, Eastern and South Central Kentucky, [which] caused flash flooding, loss of power and damage of public infrastructure and private properties," an official statement read. Several parts of Kentucky were hit by tornadoes that caused multiple deaths in December 2021. "It is devastating that we are once again experiencing severe weather just weeks after the deadly tornadoes hit Western Kentucky. Sadly, some counties have been affected by both of these events. We will continue to monitor the weather and provide needed updates. Everyone be aware, stay safe and seek shelter when advised," Beshear added.
