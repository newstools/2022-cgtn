Russia is sending requests to NATO and the OSCE, asking to explain whether they intend to comply with the key security commitments, TASS news agency reported on Sunday, citing Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. "Today, we are sending an official request to our colleagues in the countries of the Alliance and the OSCE via the foreign ministry with a pressing request to explain how they intend to fulfil the commitment not to strengthen their security at the expense of security of the others," Lavrov quoted as saying. Ukraine is not ready to be a NATO member country and will bring nothing useful to the Alliance, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said in a program on Channel One on Sunday, according to TASS.
