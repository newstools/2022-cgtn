The Beijing Organizing Committee for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games (BOCOG) introduced Zhao Weidong and Yan Jiarong as its spokespersons at a press conference on Wednesday, one month before the start of the event. Zhao is the director of the Media and Communications Department of BOCOG, and Yan is a former member of the Chinese delegation to the UN General Assembly. The pair, along with spokespersons of the International Olympic Committee and the International Paralympic Committee, will co-host press conferences during the Games. "After more than six years, preparations for hosting the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games have been completed," said Han Zirong, vice president and secretary general of the BOCOG. Releasing Games-related information in a timely and accurate way is one of the most important tasks of the BOCOG, which also promotes the Olympic spirits, BOCOG noted.
