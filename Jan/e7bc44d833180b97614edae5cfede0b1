The epidemic situation in Xi'an at the end of 2021 pressed the pause button of the ancient city in northwestern China. Belgian pianist Jean-François Maljean has composed the song "Frozen City" to encourage people to defeat the COVID-19 outbreak, pay tribute to all frontline workers and send best wishes for the upcoming Spring Festival. The musician is also the author of the song "Chime of the Dawn Bells," dedicated to the Chinese people's fight against COVID-19 in 2020.
