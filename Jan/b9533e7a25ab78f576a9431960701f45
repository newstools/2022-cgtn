The Cincinnati Bengals defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 34-31 at Paul Brown Stadium on Sunday, reaching a 10-6 record and sealing the title of the American Football Conference (AFC) North Division. Quarterback (QB) Joe Burrow of the Bengals beat his Chiefs counterpart Patrick Mahomes in this top-passer matchup by completing 30 of 39 passes for 446 yards and four touchdowns (TDs). Burrow's incredible performance helped the Bengals rally from a 28-17 deficit in the second half to win the home game. "We were talking about the playoffs, and I said the goal was the playoffs and the easiest way to do that is to win the division," Burrow said. "Everyone kind of laughed at us a little bit, but we knew the kind of team we had and the kind of guys in the locker room we had and we knew we could go out and do it." This will be the first time for the Bengals to reach the NFL playoffs since 2015. The team finished the previous two seasons with a 2-14 record in 2019 and a 4-11-1 record in 2020. But that's why they could draft Burrow (first-overall selection in 2020) and Ja'Marr Chase (fifth-overall selection in 2021) as the foundations of a competitive squad. Chase scored three TDs with 11 catches for 266 receiving yards in Sunday's game, setting a new franchise record for single-game receiving yards. Burrow refreshed the Bengals' team records too by passing for a total of 4,631 yards and 36 TDs so far this season. The Chiefs saw their winning streak stop at eight after the road loss on Sunday. Mahomes' put forward a solid performance, completing 26 of his 35 passes for 259 yards and two TDs, but was outshined by the better work of Burrow. The game was tied 31-31 with less than two minutes left and the Bengals faced fourth-and-goal on the 1-yard line. Instead of kicking a field goal, the Bengals opted to take a shot at the end zone. Though they failed, offsetting penalties were called for offensive and defensive holding, giving the home team another try. The Bengals' next attempt also failed, but the Chiefs were penalized for an illegal use of hands, giving the Bengals yet another shot. In the end, Evan McPherson scored the game-winning 20-yard field goal for the home team. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid was not happy that his team lost 83 yards because of 10 penalty calls. "I'd like to comment on each one, but I don't want to be fined," Reid said at the post-game press conference. Bucs win, but what's wrong with Antonio Brown? The Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the New York Jets 28-24 at MetLife Stadium on Sunday to improve their record to 12-4, ranking third in the National Football Conference (NFC). The Jets, who had already been ruled out the postseason because of their disappointing 4-11 record, gave the reigning Super Bowl champions a head-on blow leading by as many as 14 points (24-10) in the third quarter. Though their young QB Zach Wilson was not in his best form (19-33 for 234 yards and one TD), the Jets caused the Bucs a lot of trouble on the ground with 150 rushing yards. Ty Johnson and Braxton Berrios both scored one rushing TD. Berrios also connected with Wilson for a TD. The Bucs were still trailing 24-20 in the final minute of the game, but fortunately for them, Tom Brady was running their offense. He found Cyril Grayson on a 33-yard pass for the game-winning TD – third passing TD for the 44-year-old in the game. Brady completed 34 of 50 passes for 410 yards in Sunday's game. He continues to lead the league in both passing yards (4,990) and passing TDs (40). As close as the game was, what happened in front of the Bucs bench in the third quarter probably caught more attention. Bucs wide receiver Antonio Brown suddenly took off his jersey, pads and undershirt, threw them into the crowd and left the stadium. Brown's teammates Mike Evans and O.J. Howard tried to clam him down but were unsuccessful. Coach Bruce Arians told Brown to go back to the game twice, he didn't listen. ESPN revealed that Brown was not benched, but "quit." "I'm not talking about him. He's no longer part of the Bucs," Arians said after the game. No one knows why Brown exited the field like this, possibly ending his time in Tampa Bay, if not his NFL career.
