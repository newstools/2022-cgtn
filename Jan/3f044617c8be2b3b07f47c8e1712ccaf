Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday said that his country supports the Maldives in advancing social and economic development. Wang made the remarks when meeting the press alongside his Maldives counterpart Abdulla Shahid, while visiting the South Asian country after his trips to Eritrea, Kenya and the Comoros. The Chinese diplomat hailed the relationship between the two countries, calling it a model for country-to-country exchanges and win-win cooperation. He listed the assistance China has provided the Maldives over years, including the expansion of the country's Velana International Airport, the construction of China-Maldives Friendship Bridge and the over 10,000 houses built to improve locals' living conditions. China and the Maldives are now jointly constructing the Maritime Silk Road, and that coincides with the mutual interests of the two peoples, Wang said, adding that the two countries are jointly building a road of hope, prosperity and happiness.
