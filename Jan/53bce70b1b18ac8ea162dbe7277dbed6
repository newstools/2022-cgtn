A scientific program titled "A night of science for the young" launched by China Media Group (CMG) will air at 7:30 p.m. BJT on January 2 via CMG's 5G new media platform, Yangshipin. Themed "Happy New Year on Mars," the program will be jointly launched by the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST), the Chinese Society of Astronautics, the Bureau of Science Communication at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the International Astronautical Federation, and over 20 domestic and foreign organizations.The first immersive science show in the country, the program is a New Year gift to young people across China. To stimulate the young minds of its target audience, the program distributed "tickets to Mars" as a gift and released images of Mars captured by Tianwen-1, China's Mars probe, on March 4 last year. The program's keynote speaker is Jia Yang, deputy chief designer of the Tianwen-1 probe at the China Academy of Space Technology. Hu Sen, associate researcher of Institute of Geology and Geophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Ai Sufen, a researcher at Beijing Weixing Manufacturing Plant Co., Ltd., and many other top Chinese scientists, will also be on the show. They will take part in interactive sessions with teenagers to explore interesting scientific questions together. Jia will show a 1:3 ratio model of Zhurong Mars rover in the program. He will also simulate the difference in landing speed between Mars and Earth and detail how Zhurong lands on Mars. The program aims to bring knowledge points in subject areas such as physics, chemistry, astronomy and communication together through experiments and interactive explanations to make the mysteries of science more accessible to teens.
