A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Tuesday strongly condemned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities for framing the relevant Taiwan compatriots. The DPP authorities are accustomed to fabricating various excuses to attack Taiwan compatriots involved in cross-Strait communication and cooperation, said Zhu Fenglian, spokeswoman for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. Zhu's comment came after a court in Taiwan sentenced Lin Huai, a Taiwan businessman to prison on charges of so-called vote buying.
