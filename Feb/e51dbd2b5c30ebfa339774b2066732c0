A special concert dedicated to the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games and Paris 2024 Olympic Games was broadcast on France's TV5 Monde on February 1, the first day of the Year of the Tiger, and on China's CCTV-15 on February 14. With performances from some 100 artists from around the world, the programs of the 110-minute concert "Peace, Friendship, Love" were recorded separately in Beijing and Paris. "Art transcends national boundaries, and the rich history and dynamic contemporary spirit of China and France are presented through this concert to jointly interpret the profound theme of 'peace, friendship and love,'" said Chinese Ambassador to France Lu Shaye. "May the friendship between China and France last forever," French Ambassador to China Laurent Bili said in his congratulatory letter.
