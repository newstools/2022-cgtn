A game of woodball played by Ningxia's Sand Lake brings visitors closer both to the lake itself and to the charm of Ningxia's winter. So what does a woodball coach think of a new visitor's skills in his first woodball match? Playing on the ice with these hoops brings us right back to our memories of the 1980s and 1990s... What a fabulous experience!
