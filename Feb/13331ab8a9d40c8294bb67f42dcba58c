Do you like owls? If you do, then you must be familiar with the long-eared owl also known as the cat owl. The animal is known for its long ear tufts. The feathers on their head are display feathers. Their ears are actually hidden beneath the feathers behind their eyes. The long-eared owl eats small mammals, including mice and voles. Here are some photos of long-eared owls taken by Lin Ge in Daqing City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
