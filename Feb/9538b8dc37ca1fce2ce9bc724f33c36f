The Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River has already begun to thaw as local temperatures rise in north China. The Wuhai stretch of China's second largest river in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has entered flooding season now due to an earlier-than-usual thaw. By Wednesday, of the 830 kilometers of the Inner Mongolia section of the Yellow River, 626.5 kilometers remained iced over, with the rest flowing with ice chunks, and the density of the drift ice was 20 to 30 percent in the thawed part. Flood control departments are on high alert against potential threats as large ice jams affect water levels and endanger residents. They are dispatching more patrolling teams and keeping a close eye on floating ice chunks.
