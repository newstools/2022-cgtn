Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday encouraged Chinese winter sports athletes to strive for "a splendid life" and devote their youth and strength to the motherland and the people. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in reply to a letter from Chinese snowboarder Su Yiming. In his letter, Xi congratulated Su and other Chinese winter sports athletes on their outstanding achievements at the Winter Olympics, saying they have fought bravely and gone beyond themselves. Eighteen-year-old Su made history for China by winning the snowboard men's slopestyle silver and the snowboard men's big air gold medal at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games Su had previously written in his letter that he felt lucky to be born in a great country, grow up in the best era and realize his dreams through hard work. Xi replied that the new era is the era for dream chasers, and the era for the majority of young people to achieve their dreams. He voiced hope that the young generation could always be committed to the motherland and aspire for high and grand goals while staying firmly rooted on the ground.
