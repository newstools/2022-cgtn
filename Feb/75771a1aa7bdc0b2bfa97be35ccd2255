China's Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday that it is irresponsible under the current circumstances to wield inflammatory rhetoric when addressing the Ukraine situation, and it urged all parties to create the conditions necessary for a political solution in a fair and open manner. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin warned at a press conference that advocating for confrontation is a regression to the obsolete Cold War era tactics.
