The foreign ministers of the United States, Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) on Saturday said that the door is open to dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), jointly insisting they have no "hostile intent" toward the DPRK, Kyodo News reported on Sunday. The trilateral talks in Honolulu came after the DPRK conducted a series of missile tests since the start of the year.
