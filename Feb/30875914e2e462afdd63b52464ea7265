The authority of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) tried to increase its exposure by frequently mentioning Ukraine, revealing the fact it colludes with external forces and covers up the fact that Taiwan is part of China. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks after recent claims from the Taiwan region that the DPP authorities will sanction against Russia over the Ukraine issue. He also urged some countries to stop playing the "Taiwan card" and reiterated that the mainland firmly opposes any plots that seek "Taiwan independence." No one can obstruct the historical trend of China's reunification nor the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, he stressed. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also warned that the Taiwan authorities do not let a single opportunity go by without grabbing international attention, which is a cheap trick that will not get its way, on Friday.
