In a video circulating online, Prince Albert II of Monaco received a dough figurine of Bing Dwen Dwen at Beijing's Great Hall of the People, before asking for a second one - because his children are twins. Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday met with the prince in Beijing, expressing the hope that his twins will grow up to be as talented and passionate as their father about winter sports in future.
