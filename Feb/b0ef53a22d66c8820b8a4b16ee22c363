Storm Eunice killed at least nine people in Europe on Friday, pummeling Britain with record-breaking winds and forcing millions to take shelter as it disrupted flights, trains and ferries across Western Europe. The storm knocked out power for tens of thousands of people and shredded the roof of London's O2 Arena, Reuters reported. In the Netherlands, four people were killed by toppled trees. In Belgium, high winds brought a crane down onto the roof of a hospital, and a British man died after being blown from his boat into the water. Irish broadcasters RTE reported that a man died in Ireland after being struck by a falling tree while clearing storm debris.
