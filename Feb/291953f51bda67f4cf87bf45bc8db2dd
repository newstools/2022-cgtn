Slovenia won gold in the inaugural mixed team ski jumping event at the Winter Olympics on Monday, but it was a competition marred by controversy. Russia finished second at the National Ski Jumping Center in Zhangjiakou, and Canada took a surprise bronze. However, controversy struck when three jumpers from major medal contending teams – Sara Takanashi of Japan, Daniela Iraschko-Stolz of Austria and Katharina Althaus of Germany – were disqualified in the first round over non-regulation suits. As a result, their first jumps were not counted. Austria and Japan still made it to the final round with a serious point disadvantage. But Germany found itself out of a competition many had expected it to win. The mixed team event involves four jumpers – two men and two women – from each team, and their results are then combined to determine which team proceeds to the final round. With one of their four jumps not counted, Austria, Japan and Germany slid down the table. This left the room free for Slovenia – which already nabbed gold and bronze in the women's normal hill on Saturday – to come out on top with strong performances by Ursa Bogataj, Nika Kriznar, Peter Prevc and Timi Zajc.
