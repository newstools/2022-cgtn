Russian presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday that the Kremlin does not rule out the possibility of contacts between Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Joe Biden, Sputnik news reported. But Peskov said it is premature to talk about a Putin-Biden summit at the moment. "The meeting is possible if the heads of state consider it appropriate," he said. "Currently, there is a clear, concrete understanding of the need to continue the dialogue at foreign minister level." U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken will meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov on Thursday amid escalated tensions over Ukraine. The White House confirmed on Sunday that Biden agreed "in principle" to French-brokered summit talks with Putin after the meeting between the two countries' top diplomats. Since December, the Russian and U.S. presidents have held three sets of talks on Ukraine, including a video conference on December 7 and two phone calls in late December and earlier this month. The two leaders held their only face-to-face summit in June last year.
