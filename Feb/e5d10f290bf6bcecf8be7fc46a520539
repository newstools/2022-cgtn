The Lantern Festival falls on the 15th day of the first month of the Chinese lunar calendar, which is February 15 this year. The traditional festival signals the end of Spring Festival celebrations, and brings the festive atmosphere to a final climax.In addition to lantern shows, solving lantern riddles, eating sweet dumplings and other folk activities, this time-honored festival was regarded as Valentine's Day in ancient China. People in ancient China were restricted by a night curfew. The Lantern Festival presented one of the few chances for young women to leave their homes at night, which allowed them to meet eligible young men. Unmarried men and women could stroll the well-decorated streets and enjoy the romantic atmosphere at this time of year. "The Lantern Festival is really a romantic festival," said Zhong Fulan, director of the Shanghai Folk Culture Society. "Since the Tang (618-907) and Song (960-1279) dynasties, the Lantern Festival has been very lively, the lights at night are spectacular." Many romantic poems with Lantern Festival themes depict ardent love and profound thoughts. Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279) poet Xin Qiji's poem "The Lantern Festival Night – To the Tune of Green Jade Table" is one of them. But in the crowd once and again, I look for her in vain. When all at once I turn my head, I find her there where lantern light is dimly shed.The classic line, which describes how the protagonist looked for a woman standing in the crowd, is still widely quoted and circulated today.
