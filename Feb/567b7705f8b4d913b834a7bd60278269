The Los Angeles Rams defeated the Cincinnati Bengals 23-20 in Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium on Sunday, becoming the second NFL team to win the top honor at home. Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow, who was sacked 51 times in the regular season, almost kept a clean shirt in the first half with one sack, which allowed him time to find receivers Ja'Marr Chase and Joe Mixon. However, he didn't escape the teeth of Aaron Donald and Von Miller in the second half, during which he was sacked six times. Rams receiver Cooper Kupp, who caught eight catches for 92 yards and two touchdowns, was named Super Bowl MVP. Both Matthew Stafford and Burrow won their first playoff game this season before going all the way to Super Bowl. In the end, Stafford, who is in his 13th season, lifted the Lombardi Trophy.
