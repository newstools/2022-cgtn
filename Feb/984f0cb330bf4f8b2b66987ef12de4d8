Five tourists and two crew died Friday when their plane crashed on a trip to view Peru's famous Nazca lines, the Transport Ministry said. The Cessna 207 single-engine plane belonging to the Aerosantos tourism company came down shortly after takeoff from the small airport of Maria Reiche in Nazca around noon, it said in a statement. There were no survivors among the seven on board. The tourists were two Chileans and three people from the Netherlands, the civil defense office in Nazca said. Dozens of planes operate from the Maria Reiche airfield, flying tourists – mainly foreigners – over the Nazca lines, a UNESCO World Heritage site.
