Canadian rescuers said Tuesday they have recovered three more bodies after a Spanish fishing boat sank off Canada's east coast overnight, bringing the death toll to 10, AFP reported. "Regrettably, JRCC Hfx can confirm that an additional three deceased individuals have been recovered from the sunken fishing vessel," tweeted the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre in Halifax. Eleven people are still missing, and three sailors have been rescued out of the 24 people on board the boat.
