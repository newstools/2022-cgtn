Chinese scientists announced to have observed critical diverging behavior of entropy wave decay in Fermi superfluids at the strong interaction limit, which laid a foundation for further research in quantum simulation, the official website of the University of Science and Technology of China reported on Monday. The observation, made by a research team led by Pan Jianwei, member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and professor at the University of Science and Technology of China, together with an Australian research team, was published on February 4 (BJT) in Science magazine, a peer-reviewed academic journal of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and one of the world's top academic journals. The Science magazine reviewer spoke highly of this work. This paper presents spectacular "tour de force" experiments, the magazine said, adding that it could be a milestone in quantum simulation. The observation suggests that there is an appreciable critical region of phase transition in the Fermi system, and scientists also obtained important transport coefficients such as thermal conductivity and viscosity coefficient. This work not only provides important experimental information for understanding the quantum transport phenomena of strongly interacting Fermi systems, but it's an example of using quantum simulation to solve important physical problems. Furthermore, this achievement lays a foundation for further quantum simulation research and understanding of anomalous transport phenomena in strongly correlated Fermi systems.
