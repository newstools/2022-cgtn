The Beijing Winter Olympics will open on Friday, with thousands of athletes from across the world joining the event in the Chinese capital city. Taikonaut Wang Yaping has conducted a special Olympic-themed lecture from space to cheer for the athletes. Wang performed a chemical reaction experiment to create distinctive colors on a model of the famous Olympic rings aboard China's space station. She first extended her goodwill to the big event. "The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics will begin soon. When it comes to the Games, I believe everyone will think of the Olympic symbol, the five rings," she said. "Although we are in space for missions, we are looking forward to the Beijing 2022 just like you on earth. Today we're going to create Olympic rings on the space station by a chemical experiment." Wang then introduced her apparatus and showed the whole process of creating the Olympic rings model by using several kinds of chemical solutions to create magic reactions, elaborating to the viewers on the related chemical principles. After she placed pH indicators in different solutions, their colors changed according to the pH. Wang "painted" the Olympic rings with five colored solutions in the shape of the five rings. Wang, together with her two male crewmates Zhai Zhigang and Ye Guangfu, then showed off the Olympics rings model and sent their best wishes to the Games. "We are all looking forward to Beijing 2022. Let's cheer for all the Olympic athletes, and wish them all the best of luck." The three crew members were sent to China's space station aboard the Shenzhou-13 spaceship last October for a six-month mission, the longest in-orbit duration for taikonauts.
