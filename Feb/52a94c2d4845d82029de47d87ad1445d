A wild red panda was spotted staggering through the snow in Wawushan Nature Reserve, located in southwest China's Sichuan Province, on Tuesday. A staff member of the reserve recorded the sight with his smartphone. In the video clip, the cute little red panda cub was seen wandering around in the snow. The red panda is under second-class state protection in China. It is an endangered species due to population decline. In China, red pandas mostly inhabit the southwestern provinces of Sichuan and Yunnan. (Cover images via VCG.)
