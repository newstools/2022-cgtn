The three-day NBA All-Star Weekend ended at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland on Sunday. The floor on Sunday night belonged to two superstars, LeBron James and Stephen Curry. Both were born in Akron, which is less than an hour of drive from Cleveland. Curry drained a record of 16 3-pointers for Team LeBron to score 50 points, which were only two points away from matching the All-Star score record. It made perfect sense for him to receive the newly designed Kobe Bryant All-Star MVP trophy. James' general stats were not as good as Curry's, but the 37-year-old made the game-winning shot for his team when both sides were only one field goal from victory. The incredible performance of Curry, James and other experienced star players, including Joel Embiid, made the best compensation for the All-Star Weekend after likely the worst Slam Dunk Contest in history.
