Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday urged efforts to speed up fostering world-class enterprises and strengthen the cultivation of talents in basic academic disciplines. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks while chairing the 24th meeting of the central commission for deepening overall reform. Several guidelines on the above-mentioned issues were reviewed and adopted at the meeting, along with other suggestions on advancing high-quality development of inclusive finance and enhancing state-owned enterprises' capabilities of developing original technology. Xi, also head of the Central Commission for Deepening Overall Reform, stressed the need for upholding the Party's overall leadership and developing a high-standard socialist market economy. There must be no irresolution about working to consolidate and develop the public sector and no irresolution about working to encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector, he said. China will accelerate the building of world-class enterprises with outstanding products and brands, leading innovation and modern governance, Xi stressed. The country will promote high-quality development of inclusive finance and build a sound financial system, which is highly adaptable, competitive and inclusive, to better meet diversified financial needs of the people and the real economy, the president added. Xi also stressed the importance of efforts to train a large number of basic research talents urgently needed for China's innovation-driven development, and encouraged state-owned enterprises to improve their innovation systems and develop sources of original technologies.
