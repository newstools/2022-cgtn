A hostage siege at an Apple Store in Amsterdam ended late Tuesday, hours after it began, with the armed assailant under arrest, Dutch police said. "He is lying in the street and a robot is checking him for explosives," police said on Twitter, adding that the last hostage held in the shop had been moved to safety.
