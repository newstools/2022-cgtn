A festive mood is in the air as places across China have set up lanterns and light installations to welcome the upcoming Lantern Festival. The over 2,000-year-old traditional occasion, celebrated on the 15th day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar, marks the end of the Spring Festival celebrations. This year, the festival is observed on February 15. It is typically celebrated with displays of traditional paper-made red lanterns in all shapes and sizes that are embellished with creative designs.
