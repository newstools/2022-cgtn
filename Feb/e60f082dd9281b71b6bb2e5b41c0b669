Former Honduras President Juan Orlando Hernandez was arrested at his own home on Tuesday after a Honduran judge ordered the arrest amid an extradition request by the United States on drug-trafficking and weapons charges. A U.S. Embassy document said Hernandez was wanted on charges that he participated in a drug-trafficking scheme between 2004 and 2022, according to Reuters. Among the charges, Hernandez, 53, is accused of participating in an operation to receive in Honduras tonnes of cocaine from Colombia and Venezuela, the document said. The cocaine was then to be shipped to the United States. The embassy also said Hernandez, who was president from 2014 to 2022, received millions of dollars in bribes in exchange for protecting traffickers from investigation and prosecution. The firearms charges include carrying, using, or aiding and abetting the use of weapons, including machine guns.
