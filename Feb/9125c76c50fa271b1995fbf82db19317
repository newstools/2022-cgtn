This season, Uncle Hanzi and Adam set out to explore a real China from the perspective of Chinese characters in the daily life of Chinese people. In Quanzhou, they explored the meaning of "home"; in Chengdu, they understood the difference between "eating" and "tasting"; in Hangzhou, they experienced the exquisiteness and delicacy of Chinese silk; on the slow train in Liangshan, they felt the enthusiasm of fellow Yi people; in Changchun, they found charm and joy in the world of snow and ice! Stay tuned for the second season of "My Stories of Chinese Characters". You can also find the podcast version on all major podcast platforms.
