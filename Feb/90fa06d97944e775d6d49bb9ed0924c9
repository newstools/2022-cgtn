30 years ago in 1992, China and Kyrgyzstan established diplomatic relations. Three decades later, China has become Kyrgyzstan's largest trading partner for imports and the fastest-growing import market over the past 10 years. 30 years on, how can we evaluate relations between the two countries? What's in store for the future? We'll also take a look at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the safety measures being taken, and the significance of Beijing being the first city in history to host both a summer and winter Olympic Games. To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Kyrgyz President Sadyr Zhaparov.
