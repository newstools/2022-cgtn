A Chinese military spokesperson on Wednesday urged the U.S. to immediately revoke a possible $100 million arms sale to China's Taiwan region, stop military ties with the island and stop sending wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces. Wu Qian, spokesperson for the Ministry of National Defense, said the U.S. move violates the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, especially the August 17 Communiqué. The Chinese side expresses strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to this, and lodged solemn representations with the U.S. side, Wu said, calling it a gross interference in China's internal affairs which undermines the relationship between the two countries' militaries as well as peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
