Ukraine agreed to hold talks with Russia at the Belarusian-Ukrainian border, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday via social media. Earlier, he rejected a Russian offer of talks in Belarus, suggesting alternative cities including Budapest and Warsaw for talks. In an appeal that he published on Sunday on his Telegram channel, he offered Warsaw, Budapest, Istanbul or Baku as a platform for negotiations with Russia. The president said Ukraine is ready for talks with Russia, but Belarus is not an option because Russia has been carrying out some of its attacks from Belarus. "We're saying no to Minsk. Other cities can be a place to meet," he said. But Belarus' leader Alexander Lukashenko said Thursday that his armed forces are not taking part in Russia's operation. Zelenskyy also said on his Telegram channel that he had spoken with Lukashenko, without providing further details. Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said a delegation including representatives of the Foreign Ministry, the Defense Ministry and other government agencies has arrived in Belarus. Peskov said Russia warned Ukraine that it would not suspend military operations during any potential talks.
