Canadian police on Friday arrested more than 100 protesters, including three organizers of the protest, and 21 vehicles were towed after the police announced their decision to enforce a crackdown in Ottawa. The police set up hundreds of checkpoints on the streets to investigate vehicles entering the urban area. Since late January, thousands of Canadian truckers and their supporters have gathered in Ottawa to oppose the Canadian government's vaccine requirement for truckers crossing the border into the U.S.
