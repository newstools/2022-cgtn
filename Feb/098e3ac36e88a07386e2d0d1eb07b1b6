Chelsea secured the only victory in the four UEFA Champions League Round of 16 first-leg games on Tuesday and Wednesday after Kai Havertz and Christian Pulisic scored two goals at Stamford Bridge to beat LOSC Lille 2-0. Juventus left Estadio de la Cerámica with a 1-1 tie with Villarreal despite Dusan Vlahovic scoring record fast goal for the visiting team in 32 seconds. Sebastien Haller had two goals for Ajax, though one of them was an own one, in the 2-2 draw with Benfica. He continues to lead in the scorer list of the Champions League this season. Atletico Madrid were only minutes from defeating Manchester United at home. The life-saving 1-1 tie had not much to do with Cristiano Ronaldo.
