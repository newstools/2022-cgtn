Sweet dumpling stores across China are seeing long lines of customers as the Lantern Festival draws near. Lantern Festival falls on February 15 this year, the 15th day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar. Sweet dumplings, also known as Tangyuan and Yuanxiao in Chinese, are the must-have snacks during the Lantern Festival. They are often filled with red bean paste or sesame paste. The sweetness of the filling is linked to happiness and the round shape of the balls is a symbol of family togetherness.
