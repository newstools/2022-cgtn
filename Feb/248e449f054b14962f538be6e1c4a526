The Libyan House of Representatives, or parliament, on Thursday unanimously voted for Fathi Bashagha as the country's new prime minister. The announcement was made by parliament spokesman Abdullah Blehig in a statement. Bashagha was the interior minister of the former UN-backed Government of National Accord before the current Government of National Unity was approved in early 2021. Interim Prime Minister Abdul-Hamid Dbeibah said on Tuesday that his government will remain in office until elections are held and will only hand over to an elected government. The parliament speaker Aguila Saleh recently said Dbeibah's government already expired, calling for appointing a new one. The Libyan parliament withdrew confidence from Dbeibah's government in September last year and kept it as a caretaker government. The Government of National Unity was appointed by the UN-sponsored Libyan Political Dialogue Forum in February last year, ending years of political division in the North African country. General elections in Libya had been scheduled for December 24 last year, but were postponed indefinitely over technical and legal issues, according to the High National Elections Commission.
