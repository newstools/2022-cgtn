Gallery Weekend Beijing, one of the Chinese capital city's largest art events, will return to the 798 Art Zone, Caochangdi Art District and other sites from May 25 to June 5. Founded in 2017, Gallery Weekend Beijing aims to build a professional forward-thinking international platform for conversations about contemporary art. According to its director Wang Yifei, the event will include 38 galleries and institutions. A special exhibition for the main section will be held at the 798 Art Center as well as the curated programs. A "visiting section" will feature nine galleries from cities like Berlin, Chengdu, London and Shanghai, with participants including Sadie Coles HQ, Almine Rech and Timothy Taylor. Taking the "city" as the focus of their presentations, galleries under this section will stage exhibitions that inject energy and contextual diversity into Beijing's contemporary art scene. Also, the "public sector" will showcase ambitious site-specific projects in the public realm that transcend traditional art spaces and engage visitors. The "up&coming sector" will also return this year in the form of a talk program bringing together guest speakers with different perspectives to discuss the future of contemporary art. The aim is to provide the public with the opportunity to learn more about art over six days and provide Beijing residents with an insightful guide to art exhibitions in their city. "Sharing has been chosen as the theme for this year's event, paving the way for the Beijing-rooted cohesive platform to promote international art exchanges, partnerships, and a collegial and sustainable art ecology fostered by galleries, institutions, and artists," Wang said.
