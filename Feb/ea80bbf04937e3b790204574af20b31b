For Chinese people, the tiger is more than a big cat, or the king of the jungle. It is also the third animal in the 12-year cycle of animals known as the Chinese zodiac, and it is also the animal for 2022 - the Year of the Tiger. What characteristics of the tiger can we expect this year? How do Chinese people normally celebrate the New Year? And what does your Chinese zodiac animal tell you about your own personality? To find out more, we've invited David Moser, associate professor at Capital Normal University in Beijing; Joanne Cheng, intercultural critic and author; Wang Dan, chief economist of Hang Seng Bank (China); and Duan Yanling, board member of BlockBase Trust.
