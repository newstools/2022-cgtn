The Biden administration has ordered the National Archives to hand over records from former U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol riot, despite efforts by former President Trump to keep them private. David Ferriero, archivist of the United States, told Trump in a letter on Tuesday that he will disclose the vice-presidential records as of December 8, 2021, to the January 6 committee. The National Archives will deliver the records to the select committee on March 3 "unless prohibited by court order," Ferriero wrote.
