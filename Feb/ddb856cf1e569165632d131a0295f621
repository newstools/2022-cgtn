All Sydney trains have been suspended on Sunday as the government failed to reach an agreement with the railroad union on the issue of railroad workers' salary hike. Government officials criticized the strike and insisted on "no concession." "I won't be conceding on unreasonable things," local Transport Minister David Elliott said, according to local media.
