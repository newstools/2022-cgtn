Russian President Vladimir Putin and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson exchanged views on the situation in Ukraine and Moscow's security proposals in a phone call on Wednesday, with Putin drawing attention to Kiev's non-compliance with the 2015 Minsk agreements, the Kremlin said. The conversation came shortly after the U.S. announced that it would deploy 3,000 additional troops to Germany, Poland and Romania. Putin also pointed to NATO's "unwillingness" to formulate an adequate response to Russian security proposals, adding that the alliance is "hiding behind" its commitment to the "open door policy," which contradicted the principle of indivisible security. Johnson stressed the importance of dialogue and diplomacy, and the need to include Ukraine, according to a government statement, which added that the leaders agreed that an escalation is "in no one's interest." Johnson had discussed security issues with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kiev on Tuesday. (With input from Xinhua)
