In figure skating pairs, China's two-time world champions Sui Wenjing and Han Cong broke their own world record to finish first in the short program on Friday. Sui and Han won silver in PyeongChang four years ago and have two golds and three silvers from World Championships. On Saturday night they will be the final pair to take to the ice at the Capital Indoor Stadium and are the favorites to win their first Olympic crown.
