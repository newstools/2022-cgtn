A 5-year-old boy trapped for five days in a well in northern Morocco died before rescuers were able to reach him late on Saturday after removing much of the adjacent hillside, two government officials said. Social media footage showed the scene after his body was recovered, with hundreds of distraught rescuers and onlookers gathered at the site, chanting and shining their flashlights into the sky. Rayan Awram fell into the well in his village of Ighran on Tuesday, triggering a huge rescue effort that engrossed the nation. King Mohammed VI has sent condolences to his parents, state media has reported.
