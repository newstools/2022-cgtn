Twenty militants and nine soldiers were killed during recent insurgent attacks on two military bases and the military's subsequent response in southwest Pakistan's Balochistan Province, the military said on Saturday. The attacks, the biggest in recent years by ethnic Baloch insurgents, began on Wednesday night. "A total of 20 militants were killed during Panjgur and Nauski operations. Security forces have completed the clearance operation today," the military's statement read.
