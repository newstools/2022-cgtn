The National Aquatic Center, one of the iconic venues from the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, is better known as the "Water Cube". The venue was repurposed for Beijing 2022 and transformed into the "Ice Cube" to stage the curling competitions. The "Ice Cube" has four sheets of ice which allow up to four matches at the same time. Curling is the longest running competition at the Winter Olympics and the mixed doubles started on Wednesday while the women's gold medal match is scheduled for February 20, the final day of the Games.
