Beijing 2022 has become the most viewed Winter Games ever in China. The number of viewers on the official website has hit over 45 million within a span of one week. That's more than the entire run of PyeongChang 2018. The Olympic Broadcasting Services said it has been delivering live feeds and digital content to broadcasters amid COVID-19 restrictions. New high-definition technologies are also being used for the first time, including 3-D playback, for what organizers call a more immersive experience.
