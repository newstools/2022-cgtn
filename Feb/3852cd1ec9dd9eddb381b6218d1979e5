China has built its largest fishery and photovoltaic complementary power project in the city of Wenzhou in eastern Zhejiang Province. The Taihan project covers a surface area of approximately 4.7 square kilometers, with photovoltaic power generation on top and fish farming underneath. It is expected to contribute an average of about 650 million kilowatt-hours of electricity to the grid annually, which is enough to power 130,000 households.
