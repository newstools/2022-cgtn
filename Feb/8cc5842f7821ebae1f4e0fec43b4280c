At the National Alpine Ski Center, there were 14 volunteers from Beihang University who served as assistants at the venue communication center during the Winter Olympics, and they will continue their duties at the Winter Paralympics. The "Snow Feiyan" was built on top of Haituo Mountain in the Yanqing competition zone and the altitude difference between the working areas can be up to 2 kilometers. The 14 volunteers have electronic communication and computer backgrounds and make up the venue's command room. As of now, the venue conversion has started, and the track will soon open for official training.
