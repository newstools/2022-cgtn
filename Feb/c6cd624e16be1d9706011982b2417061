Kai Havertz scored a penalty deep into extra time as Chelsea defeated Brazil's Palmeiras 2-1 in the Club World Cup final in Abu Dhabi on Saturday to complete their collection of major trophies. Romelu Lukaku's superb header gave the European champions the lead on 54 minutes but Raphael Veiga leveled from the spot for the Copa Libertadores winners just past the hour in Abu Dhabi. Havertz, the hero in the Champions League final against Manchester City, was Chelsea's match-winner again as he converted a penalty on 117 minutes that was awarded following a VAR review. "It's amazing. After champions of Europe, we are now champions of the world. It sounds better," Havertz said. "I was nervous (taking the penalty), I have to be honest. It's a big penalty. It's just crazy. It was good I kept the nerves. I am very happy." Chelsea become the third English side to win the global tournament after Manchester United and Liverpool. For Palmeiras there were tears, but no shame. "I'm going to ban my players from not celebrating second place," manager Abel Ferreira said. "Woe to them if they get on the plane and don't have a beer. If you don't, you'll have to deal with me. I'm proud of what we did."
