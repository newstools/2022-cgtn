This morning was the first two heats of the women's skeleton at the National Sliding Center in Yanqing and China's Zhao Dan did very well to sit in fourth place. The electrifying sliding discipline skeleton is relatively new sport in China, but Zhao was given the honor to be one of China's flag bearers for the opening ceremony. The 19-year-old was recruited by the Chinese national team in September 2018 and at China's first appearance in the event at the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in Lausanne, Zhao finished in seventh place. Then at the 5th International Bobsleigh & Skeleton Federation Cup in Innsbruck, Austria, in November 2021, Zhao claimed her first win. Her best finish at a World Cup race is 15th place.
