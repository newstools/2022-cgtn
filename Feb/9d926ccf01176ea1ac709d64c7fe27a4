China successfully launched 22 new satellites in a single ride on Sunday morning, setting a new record, from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in southern Hainan Province. A modified version of China's Long March-8 carrier rocket blasted off at 11:06 am and flew for more than 15 minutes before deploying all of the 22 small satellites into their designated orbit. The satellites, built by seven institutes and private companies, have individual tasks including collecting commercial remote-sensing data, environmental monitoring, forest fire prevention and disaster reduction. Today's launch marks the 409th mission of China's Long March rocket series.
