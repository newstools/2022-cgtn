Food delivery platforms will be asked to cut service fees for restaurants and give discounts to those in pandemic-hit regions, as part of a package of policies China issued on Friday to support service industries. Shares of Meituan, China's largest food delivery platform, closed around 15 percent down on Friday after the guideline was issued by National Development Reform Commission (NDRC). The measures also include subsidies of at least 50 percent on expenditure spent on pandemic prevention measures at restaurants like sterilization, China's top economic planner said in the statement. Financial institutions should offer more credit to restaurants and qualifying businesses will be encouraged to issue bonds to expand their financing channels, according to the statement. Similar support measures are also offered for other service industries, including retail, tourism, and transportation.
