With the Beijing Winter Olympics now over, athletes from overseas have gradually left China, and in the Zhangjiakou Olympic Village, the transformation process is now underway for the Winter Paralympics. The Village received more than 2,300 athletes and team officials for the recently concluded Games and the site is now making sure facilities are in the right condition ahead of the arrival of the next set of competitors. Signs and branding for the upcoming event have also been swapped with a new wheelchair repair center set to open in the next few days. The venue operation team director says everything is running smoothly with close to 700 athletes and officials set to enter the Village.
