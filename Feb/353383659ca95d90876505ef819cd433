China's State Council has approved setting up more cross-border e-commerce pilot zones in 27 Chinese cities and regions, attempting to further stabilize foreign trade and investments. The new pilot zones, including those in Erdos in northern Inner Mongolia and Yangzhou in eastern Jiangsu Province, will replicate and advance the experience learned from the previous 105 pilot zones established in five batches since 2015, according to a statement released by the State Council. In addition to promoting the high-quality development of trade, the authority also stresses efforts to ensure national security, internet security, data security and biological security to foster an amicable business environment for market entities. The new business model has become a vibrant force driving China's foreign trade growth. China's cross-border e-commerce has expanded much faster than overall foreign trade and its share in overall foreign trade has risen significantly. According to official data, China's total trade in goods moved up another notch in 2021, exceeding $6 trillion for the first time, despite the pandemic continuing to weigh on global trade.
