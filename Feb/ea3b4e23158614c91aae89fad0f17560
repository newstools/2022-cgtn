The death toll from the floods and landslides caused by torrential rain in the city of Petropolis, Brazil, has reached 198, police said on Wednesday. Rescuers are still looking for 69 people who are missing, while the overall death toll is expected to rise further. Giselle Silva, a survivor, lost her aunt in the flooding. The aunt's body has been found and identified while a cousin is on the missing list. Staring at a photo of the debris at her home, Giselle said she prayed for her cousin unceasingly during the past week. "Every time I received a message on my phone, I still thought: 'maybe it's good news about my cousin.' But it never occurred," said Giselle. More than a week after the disaster hit the city, the people of Petropolis are still looking for survivors and counting the victims. Identifying the bodies is another challenge. Local police officers have informed families that identification through fingerprints is difficult, and DNA analysis may be a better solution. There was a complete power failure in the city after the disaster that has only been partially restored. Rio de Janeiro's state government has announced the release of about $30 million for emergency repairs and another $40 million to support businesses affected. Paulo Roberto Salles, an owner of a seriously damaged shop specializing in uniforms, is counting on the subsidy. "We lost three computers, one printer and all of our inventory. But we will recover everything, yet never forget all the scenes of suffering we have seen," Paulo said. Donations from all over the country have been pouring into Petropolis to help victims, but an enormous need for daily necessities and medical supplies in the disaster-stricken area exists. "What we need most now are personal hygiene and cleaning products as well as food," said Luan Henrique, a volunteer.
