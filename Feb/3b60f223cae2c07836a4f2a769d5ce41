The U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) on Wednesday said it is reviewing complaints about Tesla's "phantom braking" issue in the latest regulatory scrutiny of Tesla's vehicle safety. "The NHTSA is aware of complaints received about forward collision avoidance and is reviewing them through our risk-based evaluation process," an NHTSA spokesperson said in a statement, which comes on the heels of a sharp uptick in consumer complaints. "If the data show that a risk may exist, NHTSA will act immediately," the spokesperson said. According to a Washington Post report on Wednesday, owner reports of phantom braking to NHTSA rose by 215 percent to 107 complaints in the past three months, compared with only 34 in the preceding 22 months. "Phantom braking" refers to when the Tesla vehicles activate the brakes unnecessarily. Tesla said that false braking increases "the risk of a rear-end collision from a following vehicle," adding that it is not aware of crashes or injuries related to the matter. The company tried to address the issue in May 2021 by dropping a radar sensor from its partially automated driving system.  In October, it recalled nearly 12,000 vehicles over a version of its Full Self-Driving beta software that caused unnecessary braking or false collision warning. The NHTSA has also been investigating Tesla's advanced driver assistant system following vehicle crashes involving emergency vehicles. The body had also probed Tesla's decision to allow games to be played on a vehicle screen while a car is moving. Tesla later dropped the feature. Tesla recently recalled 53,822 U.S. vehicles with the company's Full Self-Driving Beta software that may allow some models to roll through stop signs, posing a safety risk. (With input from Reuters)
