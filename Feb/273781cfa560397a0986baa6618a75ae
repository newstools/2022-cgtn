India's suppression of Chinese firms caused serious harm to their legitimate rights and interests, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday. India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology on Monday banned 54 Chinese apps, citing security concerns. Foreign investors, including Chinese enterprises, have expressed deepening concerns about India's investment environment, MOFCOM spokesperson Gao Feng told media at a press conference. Foreign investors have created many local employment opportunities in India, making positive contributions to the country's economic development, Gao said. "It is hoped that India will improve its business environment and treat all foreign investors, including Chinese enterprises, in a fair, transparent and nondiscriminatory manner," he said. Being neighbor countries, China and India have been mutual trade partners. The bilateral trade volume increased by 43 percent year on year to $125.7 billion in 2021, topping over $100 billion for the first time. The economic and trade cooperation between China and India has shown strong resilience and great potential, Gao said, adding that he hopes India will take measures to maintain the momentum.
