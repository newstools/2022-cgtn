The death toll from devastating flash floods and landslides that hit the Brazilian tourist city of Petropolis has risen to 94 (at least), officials said Wednesday. Twenty-four people were rescued alive, including eight children, the State Department of Civil Defense said. City Hall decreed a state of public calamity and despatched hospital teams to assist victims. Videos shared on social media showed extensive damage and vehicles floating in the streets. Petropolis is a popular tourist destination that was once the summer residence of the Brazilian emperor.
