U.S. President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Friday to free up the Afghan government's $7 billion now frozen in the U.S. The White House said it wants to direct $3.5 billion for humanitarian assistance, and the other half of the money remaining in the U.S. would be paid to the families of those killed in the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
