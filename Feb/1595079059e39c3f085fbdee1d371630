Dragging suitcases and carrying children, tens of thousands of Ukrainians rushed to the borders due to the Russian-Ukraine conflict on February 26. Some walked many kilometers through the night while others fled by train, car or bus, forming long lines at border crossings. United Nations refugee chief Filippo Grandi has said that over 50,000 people have fled Ukraine since the start of the conflict.
