Northern China's Shanxi Province has been hit by a cold spell, with Pinglu County seeing its first snowfall of the New Year. At the Sanwan Yellow River Wetlands, the winter chill has seen thousands of wild swans negate their northern migration. Local officials are keeping a watchful eye on the wetland's local wildlife. Many photographers have been mesmerized by the beautiful scenes. Around 8,000 wild swans arrived and are staying in the wetlands during the winter season. They are expected to migrate further north in a week once the temperature rises.
