Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Saturday that Kyiv was still under Ukraine's control. "We have withstood and are successfully repelling enemy attacks. The fighting goes on," he said in a new video message posted on his social media account. "We already have almost full support from EU countries for disconnecting Russia from SWIFT. I hope that Germany and Hungary will have the courage to support this decision. We have the courage to defend our homeland, to defend Europe," he added. He also said Ukraine's force had halted the Kremlin's push to oust him. "We've derailed their plan." On Saturday, the third day of Russia's "special military operation" in the Donbas region, street fighting between Ukrainian and Russian troops continues in several Ukrainian cities and districts including Ukraine's northeastern city of Sumy and northern city of Chernihiv, as well as the capital. In Kyiv, authorities also extended curfew from 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. local time between Saturday and Monday, saying violators would be considered "enemy" saboteurs.
