President of the Republic of Korea (ROK) Moon Jae-in said on Thursday he is willing to hold an inter-Korean summit without prerequisites in a joint written interview with Yonhap News Agency and seven other global news agencies. He said the U.S. and the ROK have agreed on the text of a declaration and that a summit between Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Joe Biden "is just a matter of time" if all sides wish to avoid a crisis. "Since dialogue is the only way to resolve problems, a meeting between President Biden and Chairman Kim is expected to take place eventually," he said. "As long as there is willingness to engage in dialogue, whether the summit will be held face-to-face or virtual does not matter. Whatever method DPRK wants will be acceptable," he added. Meanwhile, the president said that there is not much time left before his term ends in May and that "the timing of the incoming presidential election and its result may make it inappropriate to hold an inter-Korean summit." He also warned that the Korean Peninsula might instantly fall back into the state of crisis as five years ago if the DPRK's series of missile launches goes as far as scrapping a moratorium on long-range missile tests. According to Seoul's defense ministry, the defense chiefs of ROK, the United States and Japan agreed to closely cooperate in countering DPRK's evolving missile threats in their phone talks Thursday. The defense talks came before the top diplomats of the three countries plan to meet trilaterally in Hawaii on Saturday to discuss joint efforts to deal with the DPRK. The official Korean Central News Agency of the DPRK reported that the country test-fired a Hwasong 12-type ground-to-ground intermediate- and long-range ballistic missile on January 30, which was the 7th such test in January.
