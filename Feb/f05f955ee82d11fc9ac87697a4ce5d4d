Colombian President Ivan Duque confirmed Thursday that 15 members of the former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) were killed during a military operation in northeastern Colombia. "Thanks to a joint operation of our Public Force in Puerto Rondon (Municipality), Arauca (Department), 15 members of the 10th front of the FARC dissidents were neutralized, among them their leader alias 'Arturo' (Jorge Eliecer Jimenez), while five more criminals were wounded," the president tweeted. Authorities told local press that the action involved members of the army, air force and police. Demobilized in 2016, the FARC became an opposition political party. However, some dissident members did not turn in their weapons and continue operations.
