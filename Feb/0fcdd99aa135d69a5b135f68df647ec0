One woman and four children have died in a house fire in Monroe County, Pennsylvania, U.S., local media reported on Friday, citing the county's coroner Tom Yanac. This is the second time in recent memory in the local region that children's lives have been lost after a house fire. Two children, along with their father, also died in a fire on Christmas Eve last year.
