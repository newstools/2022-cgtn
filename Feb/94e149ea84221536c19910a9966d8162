Japan plans to extend COVID-19 quasi-emergency measures in 16 prefectures including Osaka, Kyoto and Fukuoka to early March to curb coronavirus infections, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said Thursday. Meanwhile, the government will raise the number of people allowed to enter the country to 5,000 a day from 3,500. The quarantine period for people entering Japan will be cut from seven days to three under certain conditions from March.
