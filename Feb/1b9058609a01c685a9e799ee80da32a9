Former CGTN Sports Scene anchor Tracey Holmes is now reporting at her 14th Olympic Games, and recently became the first female journalist to receive the IOC Women and Sport Award. The ABC Australia journalist was at the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics, and in her return for the Winter Olympics, she talked to CGTN Sports Scene's Zhu Mandan about the transformation of the Chinese capital city and venues. Holmes said she was impressed by the work to transform the 2008 Games' "Water Cube" into "Ice Cube" for the 2022 Winter Olympics, and hailed the Beijing organizing committee's preparation work. The Australian discovered she has Chinese ancestry and said China's influence is felt everywhere.
