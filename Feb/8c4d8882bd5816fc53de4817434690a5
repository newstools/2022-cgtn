The common kestrel often hovers and searches for small vertebrates on the ground, such as mice, birds, frogs, lizards, squirrels and snakes. They also eat locusts, grasshoppers and crickets. The bird of prey hunts in the daytime. Once its target is locked, the bird closes its wings and swoops down to attack its prey, then flies off, quickly gaining altitude. Lin Ge loves nature photography. He has been taking photos of birds for years. Here are some beautiful pictures of the common kestrel he took in Daqing City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province.
