China Media Group (CMG) and the China Calligraphers Association (CCA) on Tuesday signed a framework agreement at a launching ceremony of the new TV program "Chinese Calligraphy Conference" in Beijing. CMG President Shen Haixiong and the heads of other relevant organizations attended the event. The seasonal TV program aims to dig deeply into calligraphy culture and showcase the history of Chinese characters and the extensive history of Chinese calligraphy, as part of the efforts to inject new energy into the ancient inscription through advanced visual presentation, and fully demonstrate China's cultural confidence, the agreement said. "Calligraphy, as an important part of excellent traditional Chinese culture, is the most representative cultural symbol of the Chinese nation, and also a symbol of Chinese spiritual temperament," Sun Xiaoyun, president of the CCA, said. "As an important platform and a display window for Chinese brands, CMG has strong communication power, guidance power, influence and credibility at home and abroad," Sun said. "The China Calligraphers Association is looking forward to strengthening exchanges and close cooperation with CMG, highlighting the beauty of Chinese characters and calligraphy in innovation, showing the spirit of Chinese aesthetics and contemporary aesthetic pursuit."
