A villager in northwest China's Shaanxi Province was lucky enough to capture the moment of a wild giant panda swimming in a river on Sunday. When hearing human's voice, the startled panda swam toward the bank, crawled up the bank and vanished into the forest. Netizens joked that the panda was Beijing 2022 Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen training for triathlon (swimming, rock climbing and tree climbing) in the next Olympics. As a national first-class protected animal, wild giant pandas are seldom seen in rural areas. Experts say the cuddly animals are actually strong swimmers.
