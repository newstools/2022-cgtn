China will promote further construction of urban environmental infrastructure to support green development. The country will establish a comprehensive, efficient, intelligent, green and safe modern environmental infrastructure system by 2030, according to guidelines issued by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) and three other government bodies. By 2025, they said China would build an environmental infrastructure system integrating sewage, garbage, solid waste, hazardous waste and medical waste treatment facilities as well as monitoring and supervision capabilities. The authorities aim to increase sewage disposal capacity by 20 million cubic meters per day, the handling capacity of household garbage to reach 700,000 tonnes daily, and the incineration capacity of urban household garbage of 800,000 tonnes per day, among other objectives, by 2025. China has had 2,618 urban sewage treatment plants in 2020 with a capacity of 192.67 million cubic meters per day, according to China's Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development. As of May 2021, the handling capacity of household garbage reached about 500,000 tonnes per day, according to NDRC. The daily incineration capacity of urban household garbage rose to 700,000 tonnes in 2020. Relevant local authorities should improve efforts to make and implement detailed measures, the guidelines said. China will continue to promote synergy between pollution reduction and carbon reduction and continuous improvement of ecological and environmental quality, eventually achieving dual carbon goals.
