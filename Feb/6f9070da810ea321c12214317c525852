The United States said a deal was possible with Iran on its nuclear program but that an agreement had to be completed urgently as Tehran advances its capabilities. "A deal that addresses all sides' core concerns is in sight, but if it is not reached in the coming weeks, Iran's ongoing nuclear advances will make it impossible for us to return to the JCPOA," a U.S. State Department spokesperson said on Monday, referring to the 2015 framework agreement. The eighth round of talks on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal will resume on Tuesday in Vienna.
