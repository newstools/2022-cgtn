The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) slammed the United States on Saturday for being the instigator of the current situation in Ukraine. The root cause of the Ukraine crisis lies in the U.S. actions that sought unilateral sanctions and pressure, while pursuing only global hegemony and military supremacy in disregard of the legitimate demand of Russia for its security, the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement.
