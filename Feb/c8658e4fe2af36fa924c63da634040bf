China's national high-tech zones have shown strong anti-risk ability and growth momentum, contributing about 13 percent of the country's GDP with only 0.1 percent of its land area, a Chinese official said at a press conference on Friday. The annual revenue of China's 169 state-level high-tech zones is expected to exceed 48 trillion yuan (about 7.6 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2021, up about 12 percent year on year, said Shao Xinyu, China's vice minister of science and technology. An initial estimate shows that profits from these high-tech zones totaled 4.2 trillion yuan, a year-on-year increase of about 17 percent, Shao added. To enable high-tech zones to play a more effective role in fostering new and high-tech industries and promoting high-quality development, China will continue to support these zones in expanding and strengthening leading industries with distinctive features, and foster a number of world-class innovative industrial clusters, Shao added. The country will also support the zones to foster emerging industries and promote intelligent, green and low-carbon industrial development. Shao also said that China will further deepen reform and foster an enabling environment for innovation and entrepreneurship. (With input from Xinhua)
