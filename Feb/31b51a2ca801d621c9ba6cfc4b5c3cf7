Iranian lawmakers have issued a statement asking President Ebrahim Raisi not to agree to a deal in Vienna unless strong guarantees are provided by Washington, CGTN correspondent Ehsan Keivani reported on Sunday. The U.S. and Europe must guarantee that they will not withdraw and that the trigger mechanism will not be used, according to the statement. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said on the same day that Iran may "shortly" agree to a new nuclear deal with major powers, but it would be "weaker" than the original 2015 agreement, according to AFP. He added that Israel was "organizing and preparing for the day after, in all dimensions."
