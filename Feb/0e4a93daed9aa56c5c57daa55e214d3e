Nathan Chen of Team USA leads the Beijing 2022 men's single figure skating event after the short program concluded at the Capital Indoor Stadium in Beijing on Tuesday. Chen set a new world record in the men's short program with 113.97 points. Team Japan dominated the top spots behind Chen. Yuma Kagiyama was second with 108.12 points, and Shoma Uno ranked third with 105.90 points. Uno, Kagiyama and Chen each broke the season's short program record, with Kagiyama and Chen breaking the world record within ten minutes of being on the ice. However, it was Chen who left with rink with both accolades at the end of the event. China's Jin Boyang scored 90.98 points, dancing to a mixed original soundtrack of "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" and landing two quadruple jumps of the Lutz and Toe loop, respectively. Despite a slightly flawed landing on his Axel, Jin concluded in 11th place after Tuesday's competition. The 24-year-old had tears in his eyes coming off the rink. His performance in the short program guaranteed him an ideal start order in the free skate phase, which will occur on Thursday. Having placed fourth in PyeongChang Winter Olympics, Jin is focused on pursuing an Olympic medal in Beijing. Japan's "ice prince" Yuzuru Hanyu finished eighth in the men's single figure skating short program with 95.15 points. The hopes of figure skating fans were dashed, as he did not attempt the elusive and highly technical quadruple Axel (4A) on the ice. Hanyu, 27, became the first figure skater ever to conquer the 4A in December 2021, before the All-Japan Figure Skating Championships. For the two-time Olympic champion, a clean 4A finish at the Olympics is equally important as defending his title in Beijing.
