Several wild species, including sables and Eurasian lynx, have been captured by infrared cameras in the Kuilehe Nature Reserve in Hulun Buir, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The sable inhabits dense forests in northeast China. In the footage, it strolled leisurely in the forest. The elusive creature is under first-class state protection in China. The Eurasian lynx, which is under second-class state protection, was also spotted. (Cover image via CFP.) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
