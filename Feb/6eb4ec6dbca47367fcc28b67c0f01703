If you happen to meet Feng Jing, you might not connect this petite woman with an Antarctica trekking expedition. When she proposed to hike across Antarctica in 2014, almost no polar guide thought it was possible because she had no skiing experience and was not good at sports. However, one famous guide Paul Landry was moved by her insistence, and she soon began the laborious five-year training without hesitation. The destination in her mind was the Pole of Inaccessibility (POI) in the middle of the continent. The spot is the most distant point from the Antarctica coastline, and the Soviets built a research station there in 1958. For many, there was no point trekking over 1,800 kilometers from the coast to the POI to see only a deserted station, but in her mind, the POI was the Antarctica she knew. Here, mother nature rules. Humans can reach it but never conquer it. A strong will can help you achieve many things. On January 25, 2020, she and two foreign assistants successfully arrived at the POI after walking from the Princess Astrid Coast for 80 days. It was the first time that humans had reached that spot on foot. She also took along mascots of the Beijing Winter Olympic Games and Paralympics, "Bing Dwen Dwen" and "Shuey Rhon Rhon," to witness the moment. Watch the video to learn about her story.
