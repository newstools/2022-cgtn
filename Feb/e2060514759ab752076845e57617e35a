The National Aquatics Center, which staged curling during the Winter Olympics and is popularly known as the Ice Cube, is now undergoing some alterations as it gets ready to host wheelchair curling during the Winter Paralympics with the competition starting on March 5.  Some temporary facilities for the Winter Paralympics were completed before the start of the Winter Olympics, making the conversion easier. The athlete's ramp is the most important facility for wheelchair curling. Because the curling takes place on the ground floor, the Ice Cube has added a temporary ramp measuring 1,340 meters, which can be used for athletes to go up and down. In last year's World Wheelchair Curling Championships, the ramp was well tested. The venue operation team's staff and volunteers will be more enthusiastic in psychological preparation and working methods, and provide more detailed and considerate services for disabled athletes.
