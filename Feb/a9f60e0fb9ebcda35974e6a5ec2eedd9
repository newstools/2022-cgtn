A total of "254 archaeological exploration projects, covering an area of 18.59 million square meters were completed along with 120 archaeological excavation projects, covering an area of 116,000 square meters. Five thousand pieces (sets) of cultural relics were unearthed.” Four archaeological sites: Zhoukoudian site, Liulihe Site, Dabaotai Han Dynasty Tomb (202 BC - 220 AD)  and Ding Mausoleum of Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) , were selected as China's "One hundred Archaeological discoveries". As a world-famous ancient capital, Beijing is rich in historical and cultural heritage resources. The city has seven world cultural heritage sites, 3,840 immovable cultural relics, and 5.01 million movable cultural relics (sets) registered in the state. What's more, the central axis of Beijing, which is connected by many cultural relics in the old city, is now applying for World Heritage status.
