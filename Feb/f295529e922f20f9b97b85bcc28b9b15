French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said that his talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin had helped reach the goal of preventing further deterioration of the security crisis concerning Ukraine. Macron told journalists that he had managed to convince Russian President Vladimir Putin not to "escalate" the crisis around Ukraine, as the West warns Moscow could be planning an invasion, which Moscow has always denied. Macron made the remarks after he arrived in Kyiv. The French president is in a meeting with his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky. On the Russian side, the Kremlin on Tuesday denied reports that Putin had promised Macron that Russia would stage no further manoeuvres near Ukraine for now. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said reports of any undertaking not to hold manoeuvres near Ukraine were "not right." (With input from Reuters)
