The International Olympic Committee (IOC) President's Trophy is a prestigious IOC award for international contributors to the Olympic Movement. The sculpture, also known as "The Sky is the Limit," was designed by renowned artist Alexander Krivosheiw. It symbolizes the story of a gold medalist, from conception to their consecration as a champion, representing growth, achievement and victory. Since 2015, approved by President Bach, the trophy was awarded to former Secretary General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Usain Bolt, a Jamaican track-and-field star with multiple Olympic medals.
