Frank-Walter Steinmeier was re-elected to a second five-year term as German president on Sunday, a prominent yet largely ceremonial post as head of state of Europe's largest economy. The re-election by secret ballot from a majority of electors was widely expected. In office since 2017, the Social Democrat and former foreign minister was supported by an overwhelming majority of delegates to the specially constituted Federal Convention, including members of the parliament and regional nominees, among them celebrities and leading figures from civil society.
