The final day of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics torch relay is underway. The three-day relay began on February 2 and the route has taken the flame through the three Olympic competition zones across central Beijing, the city's Yanqing District, and Zhangjiakou in neighboring Hebei Province. The Winter Olympic Games will run from February 4 to 20. Friday's torch relay took place on Friday morning inside a "closed loop" at the Beijing Olympic Forest Park. Torchbearers included International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach, former Secretary-General of the United Nations Ban Ki-moon, United Nations General Assembly President Abdulla Shahid, IOC Vice President Yu Zaiqing, and China's first speed skating Olympic champion Zhang Hong. World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Russia's pole vault world record holder Yelena Isinbaeva and South Korea's former table tennis star Ryu Seung-min also took part in the relay.
