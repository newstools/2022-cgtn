CGTN's Music Voyage and Chinese rapper Wang Chenyu, aka IceCraz, jointly produced a rap song called "I See It All" to highlight aspirations for Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games. He performed the song with homophonic puns as a tribute to Gu Ailing, the Chinese athlete who won the gold in women's freeski big air event at Beijing 2022.
