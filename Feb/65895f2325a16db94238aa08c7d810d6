A resident of Kyiv shared with CGTN what she saw and heard on Friday morning when an explosion rocked the building in which she lived. Irina said because a rocket was shot down nearby, its fragments hit and blasted doors and windows of the residential building. Many balconies were damaged. "It is not possible to live there anymore," said Irina, who had lived on the building's 10th floor, before the incident.
