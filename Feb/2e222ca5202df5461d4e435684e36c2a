The historical trend of Hong Kong's transition from chaos to stability and prosperity is irreversible, and any attempt to interfere with Hong Kong affairs in the name of press freedom is doomed to failure, the spokesperson of the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) said on Tuesday. The remarks came in response to a statement issued by the British Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office and some other members of the "Media Freedom Coalition" on Monday, which claims that Hong Kong authorities have targeted and suppressed independent media in HKSAR since the enactment of the National Security Law in June 2020. In response, the Commissioner's Office said that the Hong Kong Basic Law and the National Security Law safeguard lawful rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, including freedom of speech and the press. Since the implementation of the National Security Law, Hong Kong's social stability has been restored, freedom of the press has been better protected in a safe, stable and law-based environment, and the number of international media and journalists in Hong Kong has further increased. Hong Kong is a society governed by the rule of law where laws shall be enforced, the office reiterated. Noting that Hong Kong is part of China and Hong Kong affairs are purely China's internal affairs, the spokesperson urged relevant countries and groups to abide by international law, stop interfering with the rule of law in Hong Kong and stop supporting anti-China elements in the city, which fully exposed their intention of creating chaos in Hong Kong. China is determined to safeguard its national sovereignty, security and development interests and to fully and faithfully implement the principle of "One Country, Two Systems," the spokesperson said.
