Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu has urged Western countries to help reduce tensions and stop supplying weapons to Ukraine during talks with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace in Moscow. Friday's meeting was the first between Russian and British defense chiefs in recent years. Shoigu said the West needs to resolve Moscow's security concerns. Wallace described the conversation with the Russian minister as "constructive and frank." He is the latest Western official to shuttle to Moscow to seek a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis.
