This week's meeting of finance officials from the G7 has been delayed until March 1, Reuters reported on Wednesday, citing two sources familiar with the plans. Finance ministers and central bankers from the U.S., Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Canada, Japan and the EU were due to meet later this week on the sidelines of this week's meeting of G20 officials. Their meeting was delayed since most of the finance officials are not attending the G20 meeting in person, one of the sources said.
