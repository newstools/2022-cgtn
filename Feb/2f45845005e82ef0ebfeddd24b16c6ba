Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has disclosed an "urgent" phone conversation he had with French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday in which they discussed options for immediate de-escalation and diplomatic settlement in eastern Ukraine. "I informed [him] about the aggravation on the frontline, our losses and the shelling," Zelenskyy wrote in a tweet. Almost 2,000 ceasefire violations were registered in eastern Ukraine by monitors for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) on Saturday, Reuters reported citing an unnamed diplomatic source. Ukraine said on Saturday that two soldiers were killed and four more were injured during shelling in border areas as clashes between the Ukrainian military and Donbas regional forces escalated in the recent days.
