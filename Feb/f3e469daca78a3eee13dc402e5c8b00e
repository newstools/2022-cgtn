As the 2022 Winter Olympic Games kicked off, the eyes of the world are once again turning to Beijing, the first dual Olympic city. The Games coincide with the Chinese New Year, the most important holiday in China, adding a festival atmosphere to the global winter sporting event. How do the Winter Olympics appeal to a younger audience? What do they want to watch, and what are they expecting to see? To share their experience in winter sports and expectations for the Winter Olympics, we've invited Zoon Ahmed Khan, research fellow from the Center for China and Globalization; Samuel Park, who was a venue manager for the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics; Gary Mao, CEO of GIF Ventures; and Benoit Hardy-Chartrand, adjunct professor from Temple University, Japan, who is a big fan of winter sports.
