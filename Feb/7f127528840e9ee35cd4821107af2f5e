With China hosting the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, the Games are inspiring more and more of its citizens to try winter sports. According to China's General Administration of Sport, 346 million people have participated in ice and snow sports since Beijing's successful Winter Olympics bid in 2015, exceeding the country's goal of getting 300 million people involved in winter sports before hosting the Games. In particular, children are the new stars on the snow slopes. However, the boom in young skiers and ski resorts with programs geared toward children is not just due to the Olympics but also a result of government measures aimed at easing students' burdens.
