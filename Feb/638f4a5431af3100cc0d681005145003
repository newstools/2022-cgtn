A jury found three former Minneapolis police officers guilty of violating the civil rights of George Floyd, the African-American man whose May 2020 murder sparked nationwide protests. Tou Thao, 36; J. Alexander Kueng, 28; and Thomas Lane, 38; were convicted on Thursday after a month-long federal trial in Saint Paul, the sister city of Minneapolis, of showing "deliberate indifference" to Floyd's medical needs. Thao and Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop the use of "unreasonable force" against Floyd by a fourth officer, Derek Chauvin.
