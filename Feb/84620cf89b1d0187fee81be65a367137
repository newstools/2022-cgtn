The Chicago Bulls beat the Minnesota Timberwolves 134-122 at United Center on Friday to secure the second straight win. DeMar DeRozan went 14-22 in field goals (FGs) to get 35 points, six rebounds and six assists for the Bulls. This was his fourth consecutive game in which he dropped 35+points, making him the second one in franchise history to do so after Machel Jordan. After the first three quarters, the Bulls only led by one point (92-91). In the decisive quarter of Q4, they launched a 42-31 drive, and DeRozan contributed 16 points by making seven of his 10 jumpers in this quarter. Nikola Vucevic had 26 points, eight rebounds and seven assists for the Bulls after shooting at ridiculously 11-14 in FGs. He was joined by Javonte Green and Coby White in the 20-points category. Ayo Dosunmu and Zach LaVine reached double-digit points as well. "Our togetherness," White said. "When one has not got it going, others got to step up to the plate. Everybody stepped up big tonight on both ends of the court, especially in that second half. We came out with the win, the most important thing." The Bulls reached season highs in both points (134) and FG rate (63.2 percent) to claim this victory at home. The Timberwolves still relied on their three-headed monster of Karl-Anthony Towns, Anthony Edwards and D'Angelo Russell, as well as well fast-break brought by an aggressive defense. Towns, Edwards and Russell, combined 76 points, 15 rebounds and 19 assists, yet without receiving enough help from the rest of the team. Meanwhile, neither did the Timberwolves lead too much in fast-break points (16-15). "I want the fans to know this," Towns said. "This is not panic button. This is not the old Wolves, you press the panic button, everyone gotta do this, we gotta do that. We're good." The Timberwolves rank seventh in the Western Conference with a 29-27 record, 1.5 games behind the sixth Denver Nuggets and 2.5 games above the eighth Los Angeles Clippers. Caris LeVert shoots down old teammates in Cavaliers for Pacers The Cleveland Cavaliers defeated the Indiana Pacers 120-113 at Gainbridge FieldHouse on Friday, continuing to follow close behind East leading Miami Heat. Seven Cavaliers scored over 10 points in Friday's game, led by 22 of Jarrett Allen and Caris LeVert. Compared with Allen's double-double of 22 points and 14 rebounds, LeVert's performance was a more exciting story because he made all four shots of his to get eight points in the last quarter, including draining three jumpers in a row to extend the Cavaliers' lead from one (110-109) to six (116-110). LeVert was drafted by the Pacers with the 20th-overall pick in 2016 and then traded to the Brooklyn Nets. Having played about four and a half seasons in the Nets, he was sent to the Pacers in January 2021. He averaged 18.7 points and 4.4 assists in 39 games for the team before being traded again to the Cavaliers. "Tonight had a little more on it since I was just here a week ago," LeVert said. "It was definitely weird energy, just being here a couple days ago. But it is what it is, you can get traded any day in the NBA – especially around the trade deadline. But it was definitely good to get the win." "This is why they wanted him and why they were willing to give up multiple draft picks and expiring contracts and all that stuff to get him," Pacers head coach Rick Carlisle said. "I know it's not fun losing that to that guy, but I know what he's capable of." The Pacers wouldn't be unhappy to see their new guys' performance despite the loss. Tyrese Haliburton went 9-15 in FGs, including 4-6 in 3-pointers, to drop 23 points, six assists and three steals. Buddy Hield was struggling in the paint, left-wing and left corner, but he still made four triples to get 16 points in addition to nine rebounds and eight assists. The Cavaliers (35-21) are only one game away from the Heat after Friday's win.
