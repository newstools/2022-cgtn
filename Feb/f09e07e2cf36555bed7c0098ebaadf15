Asia's biggest airshow takes place in Singapore this week, with the aviation sector hoping 2022 marks a turning point in a region where tough curbs have left coronavirus-battered airlines struggling to recover. The event, which takes place every two years and kicks off on Tuesday, brings together hundreds of airlines, plane manufacturers and other industry players to display their latest equipment, network, and strike deals. International passenger numbers in Asia are rising, though from a very low base, as countries relax pandemic-related border restrictions. Asia's airlines carried 16.7 million passengers last year, just 4.4 percent of volumes seen in 2019, according to the Association of Asia Pacific Airlines. There are signs of a rebound this year, Skyscanner booking data shows, as countries such as Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Vietnam and Australia reopen to more vaccinated tourists without quarantine. The head of Finnair, which specializes in serving Asia from its Nordic hub, expressed optimism about a return towards normal business later this year. "We are optimistic about summer," chief executive Topi Manner said on Friday, adding the airline expected countries like Japan and South Korea to lift travel restrictions towards summer in the northern hemisphere. More than 13,000 trade visitors are expected at the four-day event, Leck Chet Lam, managing director of the airshow's organizer Experia, told reporters, down from nearly 30,000 in 2020 and around 54,000 in 2018. There will be no public days this time. About 600 companies will take part, down from over 900 at the last edition. (With input from agencies)
