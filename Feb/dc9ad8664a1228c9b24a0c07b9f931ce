Canada is ending rarely used special measures invoked on February 14 to tackle weeks-long protests that shut several border crossings and had paralyzed the capital Ottawa since late January, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Wednesday. "After careful consideration, we're ready to confirm that the situation is no longer an emergency. Therefore, the federal government will be ending the use of the Emergencies Act," Trudeau told a news conference. The emergency measures would formally be revoked in the coming hours when Canada's governor general signs the proclamation, the prime minister added. The Emergencies Act was approved in the House of Commons on Monday after being announced by Trudeau last week, but the act was not without opposition. The main opposition Conservative Party and some provincial leaders said invoking the powers was unnecessary government overreach. The act can grant temporary additional and necessary powers to the federal government. For example, the federal government can freeze the accounts of those suspected of supporting the blockades without obtaining a court order. Separately, the province of Ontario announced that it was terminating a state of emergency declared earlier this month to respond to the protests. Since late January, Canadian truck drivers have been rallying against the government's COVID-19 vaccine mandates, as the truckers were requested to be fully vaccinated for crossing the border into the United States. After being joined by thousands of pedestrian protesters, the rally then turned into demonstrations against the government's overall restrictive measures during the COVID-19 pandemic. The protests were brought to an end in Ottawa over the weekend. (With input from Reuters and Xinhua)
