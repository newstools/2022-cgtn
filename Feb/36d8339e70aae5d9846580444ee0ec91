China is ready to work with relevant parties to continue to make constructive efforts and resume the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. He made the remarks during a phone conversation with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian who briefed Wang on the latest progress on the issue. Wang said China appreciates Iran's principled position of resolving the issue through negotiation and supports Iran in raising reasonable demands during the negotiations. The eighth round of Vienna talks, which had been postponed for a few days, was expected to continue in Vienna on Tuesday. Amir Abdollahian said Iran is firmly committed to reaching an agreement through negotiation while effectively safeguarding its national interests. Any agreement must be reached through consultation and negotiation and cannot be unilaterally imposed on others. The final text should be the result of joint consultation, he added. Since April 2021, several rounds of negotiations have been undertaken between Iran and the other parties to salvage the 2015 deal, with the U.S. indirectly involved. In the phone call, Amir Abdollahian also expressed congratulations on the opening ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics and extended Lunar New Year's greetings to the Chinese people. He said Iran is willing to keep closer exchanges with China in all aspects to further deepen the comprehensive strategic partnership between the two countries. The two sides also exchanged views on the Afghan issue. (With input from Xinhua)
