Relations between Russia and China are developing on an equal, non-ideological basis, said Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader made the remarks in an exclusive interview with Shen Haixiong, president and editor-in-chief of China Media Group, on Thursday. "Our partnership is sustainable, intrinsically valuable, not affected by the political climate and not aimed against anyone. It is underpinned by respect, regard for each other's core interests, adherence to international law and the UN Charter," Putin added.
