The UK on Thursday scrambled fighter jets against aircraft approaching its area of interest, just a day after the Royal Air Force said it intercepted and escorted away four Russian bomber aircraft in a similar operation. "Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon fighters from RAF Lossiemouth, supported by a Voyager Tanker from RAF Brize Norton, have been launched against aircraft approaching the UK area of interest," an RAF spokesperson said.
