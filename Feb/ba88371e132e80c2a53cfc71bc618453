Former U.S. President Donald Trump took classified documents to his home in Florida after leaving the White House, the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) said in a letter to the Congress on Friday about the 15 boxes of documents it recently recovered. The Archives said it had informed the Department of Justice, which would handle any investigation. "NARA has identified items marked as classified national security information within the boxes," David Ferriero, the archivist of the United States, said in a letter responding to United States House Committee on Oversight and Reform.
