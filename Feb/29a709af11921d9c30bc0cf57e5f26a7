UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday called for human fraternity to address today's challenges. In a message on the International Day of Human Fraternity, which falls on February 4, he said the world needs compassion and human solidarity more than ever. "From deepening poverty and widening inequalities to conflict, division, and mistrust, our human family faces a cascade of challenges. To confront them, we need to challenge those who exploit differences, traffic in hate, and instill fear of 'The Other' in anxious hearts," he said. Around the world, there is a rise in hate speech, intolerance, discrimination and even physical attacks against people, simply because of their religion or belief, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation. These heinous acts are violations of human rights and affronts to the values of the United Nations, said Guterres. "Today, let us commit to stand firm against bigotry wherever and whenever we see it. Let us recognize our diversity as a richness that strengthens us all. Let us build bridges between the faiths, inspired by our common humanity. And let us come together in solidarity to create a more inclusive, peaceful and just world for all," he said.
