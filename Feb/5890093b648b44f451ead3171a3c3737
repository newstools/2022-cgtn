Technology has played a major role in China's battle against COVID-19, more so as it hosts the 2022 Winter Games. Smart mobile toilets have been a key feature of the Olympics' closed loop system and Beijing 2022 organizers say they have been an important player in the prevention of COVID-19. The whole system can be operated by just the wave of a hand, without touching anything. After the user leaves, the disinfection nozzle inside automatically sterilizes the entire space, reducing the risk of cross-infection. In addition, the water supply and sewage systems are equipped with a closed-loop disinfection device, which cuts the fecal-oral transmission chain. Over 100 of such cubicles are used in the Olympic medals plaza in Beijing and at the competition venues for alpine skiing and sliding in Yanqing District. The designer, Meng Jianmin, a member of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said, "Compared with traditional toilets, this smart toilet is more energy efficient and eco-friendly. In terms of green energy, it saves on electricity, water, land and other resources. We try our best to consider using the least amount of materials, electricity and water to reflect or promote environmental awareness." Meng says it is the first such toilet in the world because it can be used indoors. He says he's confident the product will go global soon, as more parts of the world pursue low-carbon infrastructure. "This toilet can be placed indoors. Any peculiar smell is treated, with zero emissions, odor and pollution afterward. At present, there are no mobile toilets in the world that can be placed indoors. So, ours is not only an original in China, but also an original on the global stage. It will benefit people in China and others elsewhere who use it," Meng said. Apart from the Winter Olympics, the smart mobile toilet has also been applied to more than 20 scenarios, such as at ports, subway stations, and quarantine centers.
