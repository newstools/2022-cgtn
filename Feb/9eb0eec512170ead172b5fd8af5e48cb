China's Metaverse Industry Committee said on Wednesday it had admitted 17 new firms, including three listed companies, according to a post on the China Mobile Communications Association Metaverse Consensus Circle website. The three listed companies are Inly Media Co., Ltd and two Shenzhen bourse-listed companies Beijing Topnew Info&Tech Co., Ltd and Beijing Quanshi World Online Network Information Co., Ltd. The list now has 112 firms (or members), including 21 listed companies. The China Mobile Communication Association Metaverse Committee was set up in Beijing last October 15 to study national industrial policy and mobile communication development strategy, and to keep tabs on the relationship between industrial development and government macro-control to aid in governmental decision-making. As a national social organization, the committee also coordinates with industrial experts at home and abroad in the domestic market and promotes exchanges and cooperation between industrial enterprises. So far, it has hosted various seminars, forums, research and investigation activities related to the mobile communication industry. Committee members include China's telecommunications carriers such as China Mobile Communication Group Co., Ltd, China United Communications Co., Ltd and China Telecommunications Co., Ltd. Furthermore, related enterprises and institutions, as well as insiders from government policy research department. Individuals such as experts from finance, technology and media sectors have also joined in. Experts say China's metaverse efforts are growing with surging interest. In 2021, more than 1,000 companies, including heavyweights such as Alibaba Group Holding and Tencent Holdings Ltd, applied for around 10,000 metaverse-related trademarks, according to business tracking firm Tianyancha.
