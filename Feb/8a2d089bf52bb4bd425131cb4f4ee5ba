Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva will be allowed to compete in the women's single in figure skating at the Beijing Olympics after a decision by sport's top court, the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), on Monday, Russian state news outlet TASS reported the same day. Valieva tested positive for a banned substance on December 25. The result of the positive drug test was not revealed until February 8 after she had competed in the team event at the Winter Games, dazzling the world with the first quad jumps ever completed in the women's Olympic competition. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) and the International Skating Union (ISU) had appealed RUSADA's decision to lift a provisional doping suspension of Valieva. The women's single, an event for which Valieva is hot favorite, starts with the short program on Tuesday and concludes on Thursday with the free skating.
