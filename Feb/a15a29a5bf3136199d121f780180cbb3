Former Defense Minister Tobias Ellwood has withdrawn his support for Prime Minister Boris Johnson and will be submitting a letter of no-confidence in the PM, he told Sky News on Wednesday. A vote of confidence will be triggered in this case if 54 Conservative MPs write the no-confidence letters, according to the report.
