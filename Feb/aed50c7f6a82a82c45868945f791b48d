Editor's note: "Natural Facts – Q&A" answers questions on natural conditions involving winter sports. In this episode, China Meteorological Administration explains the secrets between geography and the Winter Olympics medals. From Salt Lake City 2002 to PyeongChang 2018, the Winter Olympics held in the 21st century have produced 452 gold medals shared by 27 different participating delegations. All except Australia are located in the middle and high latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, especially latitudes between 40 degrees North and 70 degrees North. Q: How can geography influence the Winter Olympics medals? A: Firstly, the climate plays an important part. Regions in latitudes between 40 degrees North and 70 degrees North are dominated by temperate ocean and temperate continental climate. These areas have no severe cold winter but snow is often seen, which provides the basic weather condition for winter sports. Landforms are also key to winter sports. Athletes from mountainous areas are more likely to win. For example, countries around the Alps have obtained one-third of the gold medals, while countries around the Scandinavian Mountains in Northern Europe obtained 17 percent and countries around the Rocky Mountains obtained 21 percent. Q: Which regions of China have suitable a climate and landforms for winter sports? A: China has a vast territory, hence the natural conditions are of large differences. Regions suitable for winter sports are mainly concentrated in the northeastern, northern and northwestern parts of China. For example, the largest ski resort in China is located in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, called the Yabuli Ski Resort.
