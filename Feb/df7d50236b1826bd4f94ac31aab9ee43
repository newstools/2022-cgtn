The youngest member of China's delegation at the Beijing Winter Olympics is ski jumper Peng Qingyue. The 17-year-old finished 38th in yesterday's women's normal hill competition, which meant she did not advance to the final round, but she now hopes to help the host nation achieve success in Monday's mixed team event.
