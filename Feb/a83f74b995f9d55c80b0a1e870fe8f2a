The National Aquatics Center is scheduled to host wheelchair curling beginning on March 5th. The venue has added a temporary ramp that's more than 130 meters long with a gradient so many athletes can enter at once.

Athletes can use mobile phones to navigate barrier-free routes and the Games will be broadcast with a sign language digital robot.Beijing has carried out multiple rounds of inspections on more than one hundred venues and their surrounding areas. The city has already built barrier-free facilities in eight competition venues and two Paralympic villages. Organizers have also upgraded accessibility at 25 hospitals, 67 hotels, and nearly 10-thousand sites within a 1-kilometer radius of all venues.
