U.S. President Joe Biden will begin to clear a legal path for relatives of victims in September 11, 2001 attacks to pursue $3.5 billion in frozen funds from Afghanistan's central bank, which is currently deposited in New York, the New York Times reported on Friday, citing officials familiar with internal deliberations. According to the officials, Biden will also use emergency powers to consolidate and freeze all $7 billion in assets held by the Afghan central bank, and allow the remaining $3.5 billion funds to be moved to a trust fund for humanitarian relief in Afghanistan via legal pathways.
