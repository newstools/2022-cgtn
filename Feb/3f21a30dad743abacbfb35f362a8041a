China's Gu Ailing kicked off her Olympic debut campaign with a gold medal in the freestyle skiing women's freeski big air event at Beijing Winter Olympics on Tuesday. Gu, 18, achieved a total of 188.25 points from her two best attempts out of three. France's Tess Ledeux won the silver medal with 187.50 points, while Switzerland's Mathilde Gremaud took the bronze with 182.50. Gu stormed to 93.75 points in her first attempt, easily accomplishing what contributed to her World Cup success in Steamboat in 2021, double cork 1440. She scored 88.50 points in her second attempt and surprised everyone with the biggest turn of the event in her third attempt. The teen skiing sensation topped the scoreboard with 94.50 points from her last attempt, in which she accomplished a double cork 1620, putting pressure on Ledeux and Gremaud. Gu went up to hug the two skiers after Gremaud fell on the ramp, and Ledeux looked dejected, losing her leading edge in the last minute, respectively. This is the big air event's debut at the Olympics. International Olympic Committee chief Thomas Bach watch the competition in person at Big Air Shougang in Beijing. The men's freeski big air final will occur on Wednesday.
