Former Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres and conservative contender Fabricio Alvarado lead a preliminary vote tally in Sunday's presidential election, according to figures published by the electoral tribunal. No candidate is expected to win the more than 40% of votes needed to avoid a run-off, but if the initial trends hold, Figueres and Alvarado could face off in a second round in early April to decide the presidency.
