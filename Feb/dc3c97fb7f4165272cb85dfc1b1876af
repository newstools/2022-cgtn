China is firmly opposed to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's decision to revoke its "Authorization to Operate" for China Unicom's U.S. unit, the Chinese Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) said on Thursday. It added that the U.S. move seriously damages the domestic business environment and harms the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese enterprises and global consumers, including U.S. users. The ministry said that China will take necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights of Chinese enterprises, and urged the U.S. to create a fair, just and non-discriminatory business environment for Chinese investors.
