Freestyle skiing ace Gu Ailing of Team China was impressed by Big Air Shougang in Beijing for the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. "The jump is amazing," Gu told CGTN after finishing her practice on Sunday. "I think everybody's in agreement with me that it's a really well-built jump. Everybody out here in China put so much work into the infrastructure and we really appreciate it. I had a really good training day and I'm excited for qualies (qualifiers) tomorrow." As one of the biggest hopefuls for gold medals for Team China in the Winter Games, Gu will attend the competitions of women's big air, slopestyle and halfpipe.
