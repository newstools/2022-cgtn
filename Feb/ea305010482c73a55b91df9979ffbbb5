Chinese short track skater Ren Ziwei's victory in the men's 1,000m has made him an overnight sensation. Monday's win sealed his first individual Olympic gold, and the second for the host country, after he and his teammates won the 2,000m mixed relay two days earlier. And his tenacity in topping the podium lived up to his nickname of the "Unyielding Elephant."  Ren's mother said he has always been sincere, down-to-earth and tenacious since he was a little kid.
