Spring has come as early as February in many provinces in China. Cities in south and southwest China are festooned with flowers, including plum blossoms, cherry blossoms, Chinese quinces and cotton tree flowers. Sunbirds, white-eyes, bulbuls and finchbills are among the first to enjoy the beautiful spring. Check out the gallery below for a couple of images, and may the bright colors put you in a good mood.
