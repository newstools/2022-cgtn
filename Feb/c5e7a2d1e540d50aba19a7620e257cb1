Ukrainian and Russia-backed forces on Thursday traded accusations of firing shells across the ceasefire line in eastern Ukraine. The Russia-backed forces accused government forces of opening fire on their territory four times in the past 24 hours. "Over the past 24 hours, the situation on the line of contact has escalated significantly," Yan Leshchenko, head of the People's Militia in the self-declared Lugansk republic, told reporters. Meanwhile, Ukrainian officials accused the insurgents of shelling a village on the Ukraine-controlled area and injuring three people. "The Russian occupation forces shelled the town of Stanytsia Luhanska in the Luhansk region, crudely violating the ceasefire agreement," the Ukrainian military officials said in a statement.
