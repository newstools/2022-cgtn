Mali has expelled France's ambassador, accusing Paris of undermining the legitimacy of the military authorities. But according to Mali's foreign minister, the envoy is welcome to come back if Paris clarifies its position toward the transitional government. He also reiterated willingness for dialogue. Tensions have been mounting between the two sides following last year's military takeover.
