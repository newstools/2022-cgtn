The National Ski Jumping Center is nicknamed "Snow Ruyi," which is a traditional Chinese talisman. It is located in the Chongli District of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, and is the largest ski jumping venue in the world. Snow Ruyi consists of two slopes, one for the normal hill with a drop of 114.7 meters, and another for the large hill, with a drop of 136.2 meters. Eight events from the two disciplines of ski jumping and Nordic combined will be held in "Snow Ruyi." Five gold medals will be awarded for ski jumping during the Winter Olympics. In today's episode of our "One Minute, One Sport" series, we take a look at ski jumping.
