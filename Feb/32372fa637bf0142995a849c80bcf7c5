Visiting athletes have been speaking fondly of their experiences. These include French figure skaters Gabriella Papadakis and Guillaume Cizeron, who won their first gold in ice dancing on Monday, as well as Denis Airapetian, a short track speed skater from the Russian Olympic Committee who made his Winter Games debut in Beijing.
