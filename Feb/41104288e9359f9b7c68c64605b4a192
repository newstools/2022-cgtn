China's national women's football team defeated two-time defending champions Japan 4-3 on penalties after the teams were locked 2-2 at the end of extra time in their Asian Cup semifinal in Pune, India, on Thursday. Japan's Riko Ueki netted a brace while China's Wu Chengshu scored in the 46th minute and captain Wang Shanshan scored the vital equalizer to level the score 2-2 in extra time in the 119th minute. In the penalty shootout that followed, China advanced in the Asian Football Federation (AFC) tournament. China's head coach Shui Qingxia hailed the victory as a "new start" for women's football as it was the first time that the country has reached the final of the championship in 14 years. "It wasn't an easy road to today's victory. As I said before the match, I hoped the team could show the spirit of Chinese women's football and play confidently. I think they made it," she added. Captain Wang beamed, "Indeed, it was a very difficult match and the Japanese team imposed a lot of challenges to us. Especially, they had good ball possession and while passing, they have good techniques in terms of attacking." China will face South Korea in the final on February 6.
