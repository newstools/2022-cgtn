British police on Wednesday said it has launched an investigation into Prince Charles's charitable foundation over claims of a cash-for-honors scandal involving a Saudi businessman. "The decision follows an assessment of a September 2021 letter. This related to media reporting alleging offers of help were made to secure honors and citizenship for a Saudi national," Scotland Yard said in a statement.
