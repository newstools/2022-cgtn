Holiday travel across China has increased since Wednesday, the third day of the week-long Spring Festival holiday season. Some 137 million domestic tourist trips were made across the country in the first three days of the holiday, data from the Ministry of Culture and Tourism showed, generating 167 billion yuan ($26 billion) in tourism revenue. The number of tourist trips saw a 71.5-percent recovery to the pre-COVID-19 level in 2019, according to the ministry. Short-distance tourist trips, home visits and suburban trips accounted for the bulk of the travel rush. Ice and snow-themed travel has grown in popularity, as the holiday coincides with the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. Additional trains were provided in many regions to meet the transport demand. Some carriages have been adorned with festive decorations to celebrate the Lunar New Year, and specials, such as intangible cultural heritage products, local specialties and fine handicrafts, are on offer on some services. Strict COVID-19 prevention and control measures are in place for the travel rush. Passengers are required to wear masks, present Health QR codes and undergo temperature checks before departures. Also, contactless services are accessible to create a healthy travel environment for passengers.
