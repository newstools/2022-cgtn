Chinese citizens who can't attend the Beijing Winter Olympics are coming up with creative ways to show their support. That includes an acrobat from Tianjin who can twist her body into all 24 event logos from the Games.Imitating 24 logos and 24 movements might sound easy, but while completing those motions, Tao Zi constantly calibrated her posture and strived to perfectly duplicate the Winter Olympics emblems. Following the end of the Spring Festival holiday, Tao is now ready to shoot a new video to help promote Beijing 2022. And this time her crew will use professional acrobatic equipment, to integrate more high-flying skills into the final product.
