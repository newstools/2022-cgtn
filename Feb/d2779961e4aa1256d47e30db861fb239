Iran will send five athletes to the coming 2022 Winter Paralympic Games that will happen in the three competition zones of Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou between March 4 and 13, according to China Media Group (CMG). CMG was invited to an alpine skiing resort in Alborz Province, Iran, to attend training sessions of the country's para-athletes. They will send two cross-country skiers and three snowboarders to the 2022 Winter Paralympics. "I hope that, one day, we can use the modernized facilities and equipment of China to facilitate the development of (the) skiing industry in Iran. The 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics will help the friendship between the sports circles of the two countries grow stronger," Eisa Saveh Shemshaki, president of Iran's Ski Association for Disabled, told CMG. "Beijing is ready (to host athletes from all over the world)," Chang Hua, Chinese Ambassador to Iran, said. "We pay the same attention to both the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. Beijing has complete sets of barrier-free facilities on every front. I hope Iranian athletes can not only make their best for performance for good results, but also show their will power and gain more friendship." "My wish is to have a good result in Beijing," Iranian snowboarder Puriya Khaliltash said. "I hope all of my teammates and other snowboarders of other countries can achieve a better result and it would be a safe and good competition." Seyyed Mosayeb Seyd, coach of the Iranian Paralympic snowboard team, said they are targeting a better performance at Beijing 2022 than PyeongChang 2018. "We hope that given the close ties between Iran and China, good competitions would be ahead of us, and we would manage to achieve the best result," he added. The Paralympic Villages in Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou opened to serve delegations on Friday and they are expected to host some 1,700 members of a total of 48 delegations.
