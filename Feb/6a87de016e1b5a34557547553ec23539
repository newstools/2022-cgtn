China is planning more data center mega clusters as part of a strategic project aimed at "transporting data from eastern to western regions for storage and calculation." The campuses will be based in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the Yangtze River Delta, the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, and the Chengdu-Chongqing economic rim. Ten smaller data center hubs are also being considered.
