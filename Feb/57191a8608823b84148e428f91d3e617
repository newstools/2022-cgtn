China's health authorities are rolling out sequential COVID-19 booster vaccinations following the approval of the State Council inter-agency task force for COVID-19 response, a health official said on Saturday. According to the plan, people aged 18 and above who have received a full course of an inactivated vaccine can get a booster shot of a vaccine from one of several different technical lines, National Health Commission official Wu Liangyou said at a press conference. Booster shots should be administered at least six months after a full vaccination course is completed, Wu said.
