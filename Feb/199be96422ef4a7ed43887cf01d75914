Gu Ailing has been one of the hottest prospects at these Games, and put in a solid performance on her Winter Olympics debut. The freestyle skier will now turn her attention to competing in the halfpipe and slopestyle, with the aim of achieving further success in her maiden campaign at the Games. She has won multiple world cup titles in the months before the Olympics, showing her strong potential with an Olympic gold of half-pipe, on which the Chinese is deemed a better skier than on big air platform.
