Theater originated in ancient Greece and began to spread to China over 100 years ago. Chinese opera has existed for over 1,000 years. But it's losing support among younger audiences. Chinese theater director Ding Yiteng has created "The Modern Format," a new method of drama and expression for the young generation that combines traditional Chinese culture elements, such as famous ancient stories and Chinese opera, with contemporary performing techniques from both domestic and foreign sources. "I understand the Western perspective of art and aesthetics. And I love Beijing and Chinese culture," said Ding, adding that he wants to integrate different cultures.
