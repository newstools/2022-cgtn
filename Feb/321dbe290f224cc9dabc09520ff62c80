The Start of Spring, or Lichun in Chinese, falls on February 4 this year, marking the advent of the first solar term of the Chinese lunar year. As China is a vast land with different climates, the scenery can vary greatly across the nation. Let's see how regions around China say goodbye to the withered winter and usher in a vibrant spring. In the farmland of Sujiatun District in Shenyang City, northeast China's Liaoning Province, a large flock of crows forage in the farm fields. The crows need to store energy and prepare for the coming migration in warmer weather. After a snowfall on February 2, giant pandas bask in the warm sunlight at the Shenshuping base of the China Conservation and Research Center for the Giant Panda in Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China's Sichuan Province. The water in a salt lake in Yuncheng City, north China's Shanxi Province, welcomes the spring in a stunning rose color to welcome spring. The color is related to the concentration of minerals and algae in the water. If the temperature or the content of magnesium sulfate increases, the algae in the water will appear red. The rapeseed flowers are blossoming in places, such as Kunming, southwest China's Yunnan Province. The vast yellow flowers decorate the terrace field like a giant cake made by nature. Farmers in Guanling Village in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region begin plowing as spring arrives. With poverty alleviated and still in Spring Festival holiday, the village is full of green and vibrant. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
