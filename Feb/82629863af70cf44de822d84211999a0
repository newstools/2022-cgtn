Liu Jinxia is a Chinese artist who makes art out of butterfly wings. As the world becomes more urban, there are fewer forests and fewer butterfly host plants, and there are fewer and fewer sightings of butterflies in the wild. Plus, the lifespan of butterflies is short, some only live up to two weeks. In order to preserve the beauty of the butterfly for a longer time and make more people aware of the importance of butterflies to the ecological balance, Liu collects dead butterflies and makes art with their wings. Let's check out the video to learn more about this special art.
