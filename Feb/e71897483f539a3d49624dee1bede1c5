The upper body of little owls, found in Europe, Africa and Asia, is greyish-brown with scattered white spots. The bird usually comes out at night and attacks from the air like other birds of prey but also runs to catch its prey which include insects, rats, birds, lizards, frogs and other small animals. Here are some beautiful photos of a little owl standing on a branch in Daqing City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. They were taken by Lin Ge, a photographer who loves taking pictures of birds.
