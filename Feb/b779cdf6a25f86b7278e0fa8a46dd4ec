Residents of Kyiv reported hearing two loud explosions in the center of Ukraine's capital on Friday morning. "Attacks on Kyiv with cruise and ballistic missiles have just resumed. I heard two powerful explosions," Ukrainian interior ministry advisor Anton Herashchenko said on Telegram. The Ukraine army later said Ukraine's air defense systems repelled two missiles, according to a post on its verified Facebook page. Meanwhile, a fire broke out on a high-rise in Kyiv Friday morning after being hit by "missile debris," and three people were injured, Kyiv mayor Vitaly Klitschko said, adding one of them is in critical condition. Several other explosions have also been reported around Kyiv, though details are sketchy. Russia's defense ministry on Thursday said Russian troops are not targeting Ukrainian cities but are limited to surgically striking and incapacitating military infrastructure.
