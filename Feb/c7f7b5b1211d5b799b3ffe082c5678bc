The Ukrainian military says two soldiers were killed and four were wounded in a rebel attack in eastern Ukraine on Saturday. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has reported almost 2,000 ceasefire violations in eastern Ukraine. On Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said reports of Kyiv shelling rebel-held areas and the Russian border were "pure lies." He also said Ukraine will not respond to provocations and urged citizens to stay calm. His statement came as Russia said it's investigating reports of Ukraine shelling into Russia's Rostov border region. NATO says it is relocating its staff from Kyiv over safety concerns.
