The Palestinian Central Council (PCC) on Wednesday decided to terminate the commitment of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) to all agreements signed with Israel. The announcement was made after three days of meetings in the West Bank city of Ramallah. "In view of Israel's ongoing denial of the signed agreements, the PCC decided to terminate the obligations of the PLO and the Palestinian Authority to all agreements signed with Israel," its statement read, adding that Israel's persistence in accelerating the confiscation of Palestinian land had contributed to the decision.
