The South China tiger hasn't been seen in the wild for decades. It's critically endangered and can only be seen in captivity in China and South Africa. Compared to other tigers, the South China tiger is relatively smaller, weighing between 100 and 195 kilograms. They feed on large animals, including deer and cattle. Due to poaching, loss of habitat and human-tiger conflicts, the South China tiger is under China's first-class state protection. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) evaluates it as "critically endangered." Here are some photos of the South China tiger.
