The Russian Embassy in the United States has called on Washington to focus on finding a diplomatic settlement to the intra-Ukrainian conflict instead of fueling the media's "militarist rage" around the allegedly looming Russian invasion of Ukraine. "We urge the State Department not to feed the 'militarist rage' of journalists and to focus on the really important issue of diplomatic settlement of the intra-Ukrainian conflict," the diplomatic mission asserted in a Facebook post.
