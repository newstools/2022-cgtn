Former Afghan President Hamid Karzai on Sunday urged the United States to return his country's assets, one day after Washington unveiled a plan to set aside half of $7 billion frozen Afghan assets on U.S. soil to possibly satisfy lawsuits over the September 11 attacks. U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday signed an executive order that seeks to split $7 billion between funding humanitarian aid for cash-strapped Afghanistan and creating a trust fund to compensate the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. "Holding Afghanistan's money on any name is unfair and unjust. That money belongs to the people of Afghanistan ... I am calling on President Joe Biden to return the money to the people of Afghanistan," Karzai told a press conference in Kabul. Karzai said that all Afghans, including members of the Taliban-led caretaker government, should take a united stand to get the Afghan money back to their country.
