The so-called "America COMPETES Act of 2022" passed by the U.S. House of Representatives recently contains China-related content that is steeped in Cold War mentality and zero-sum game mindset, the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) – China's national legislature – said in a statement on Tuesday. The bill denigrates China's development path as well as its domestic and foreign policies, clamors for strategic competition with China, and uses issues relating to Taiwan, Xinjiang, Hong Kong and Tibet to interfere in China's internal affairs, the committee said, expressing strong dissatisfaction with and firm opposition to the move. The real purpose behind the bill is to suppress China's innovation and development, and maintain the hegemony of the U.S. in the world, the committee said. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian also commented on the bill on Monday, urging the U.S. to view China's development and China-U.S. relations in an objective and rational way.
