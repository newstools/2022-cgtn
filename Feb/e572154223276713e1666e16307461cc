German Air Force's Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets landed at a military air base in eastern Romania on Thursday as part of a deployment to NATO's eastern flanks, the Romanian Defense Ministry said. The three Eurofighters and roughly 60 soldiers will join Italian and Romanian forces for enhanced air policing missions over the next three weeks.
