Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy posted a self-made video on Friday night with key aides around him on a street outside the presidential building in capital city Kyiv. "Our troops are here, citizens are here," Zelenskyy said in the video. "All of us are here protecting the independence of our country, and it will continue to be this way," he added.
