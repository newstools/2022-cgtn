Chinese New Year is the festival that celebrates the beginning of a new year on the traditional lunar Chinese calendar. The festival is commonly referred to as the Spring Festival, as it marks the end of winter and the beginning of the spring season. Celebrations traditionally take place from New Year's Eve, the evening preceding the first day of the year, to the Lantern Festival, held on the 15th day of the year.
