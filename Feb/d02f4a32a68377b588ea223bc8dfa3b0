The congressional committee investigating the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol announced on Wednesday that it has issued a subpoena to former White House trade adviser Peter Navarro, a key player in former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his election defeat. The House of Representatives committee said it is seeking records and deposition testimony from Navarro who, according to public reporting, interviews and his own book, was involved in efforts to delay Congress' certification of the 2020 election. "Mr. Navarro appears to have information directly relevant to the Select Committee's investigation into the causes of the Jan. 6 attack on the capitol," Representative Bennie Thompson, the committee's Democratic chairman, said in a statement.
