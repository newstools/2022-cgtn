Spreading false information will not help resolve the situation between Russia and Ukraine, said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin on Thursday. His remarks followed Russia's allegation that the U.S. has been spreading false information about Russia's "invasion" in Ukraine, claiming that the risk of Russia's further "invasion" still exists. On Wednesday, Kremlin spokesperson Maria Zakharova mocked the UK and the U.S., saying, "February 15, 2022, will go down in history as the day Western war propaganda failed. Humiliated and destroyed without a single shot fired." Russian media agencies released footage showing tanks being withdrawn from Ukraine, and Russia's defense ministry said no more military equipment was left in Crimea after the drill. British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss wrote in The Daily Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday that there is no evidence that the Russians are withdrawing from border regions near Ukraine. China supports all efforts in line with the direction and spirit of the 2015 Minsk agreement, Wang said.
