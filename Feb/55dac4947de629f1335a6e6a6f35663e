China Media Group (CMG) will hold the 2022 Lantern Festival Gala on Tuesday evening to celebrate the traditional Chinese festival. With a history of over 2,000 years, the Lantern Festival is celebrated on the 15th day of the first month on the Chinese lunar calendar. It marks the end of the Spring Festival celebrations. According to CMG, the gala will feature a wide array of performances, ranging from songs, dances, cross talk and traditional Chinese opera to martial arts and magic shows. The combination of art and technology, tradition and modernity will present a cultural feast for the viewers, the media organization said. The performances will revolve around multiple themes that made the headlines in the past days, including the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games, the country's space program, and Chinese women's football team who won the 2022 Asian Football Confederation Women's Asian Cup final. There will be a creative program that integrates the best wishes sent from the Chinese space station with folk music played live on the scene, creating a magical encounter of traveling through space while presenting the charm of traditional Chinese culture. In addition, a singing and dancing performance featuring traditional lion dance together with robotic tigers and VR technology will add to the festive mood, CMG said. Meanwhile, the mascots of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon, will make an appearance at the gala. Chinese athletes Gu Ailing, also known as Eileen Gu, Wu Dajing and Ren Ziwei will also send their best wishes to the viewers across the country.
