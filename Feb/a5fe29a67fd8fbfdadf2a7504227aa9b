The Belarusian Foreign Ministry summoned Ukraine's ambassador to Belarus Igor Kizim to express a strong protest against Ukraine's illegal surveillance of its territory by sending a drone, Belarusian media reported on Thursday. A Ukrainian drone illegally crossed the state border of Belarus on January 24, was detected in the country's airspace and subsequently forced to land by specialists of the Belarusian Armed Forces. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine called the statement of Belarus about the "drone from Ukraine" a provocation and denied the use of drones; it urged Belarus to renounce moves that undermine bilateral relations, Ukrainian media reported on Thursday.
