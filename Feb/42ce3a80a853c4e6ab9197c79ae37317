Cross-country skiing is a form of skiing where skiers rely on their own locomotion to move across snow-covered terrain, rather than using ski lifts or other forms of assistance. Cross-country skiing is widely practiced as a sport and recreational activity. The sport has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the first Winter Games in 1924 in Chamonix, France. The women's events made their debut at the 1952 Winter Olympics.
