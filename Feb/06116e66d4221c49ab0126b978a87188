Barcelona's previous board, led by former president Josep Maria Bartomeu, showed "very serious criminal behavior,” a lawyer hired by the club said on Tuesday. At the presentation of the club's "forensic report" into the financial management of Barca under Bartomeu, current president Joan Laporta also said "payments without cause, payments with a false cause or disproportionate payments were found."
