Protests have entered their 12th day in Canada's capital Ottawa. The demonstrations began in late January, when a convoy of truckers and supporters arrived in Ottawa, demanding an end to vaccine requirements when crossing the U.S.-Canadian border. The protests have since morphed into a broader movement against all COVID-19 health restrictions. Hundreds of trucks with anti-government slogans are now clogging the streets of downtown Ottawa, bringing it to a standstill. Officials from the city's mayor to Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have called on them to leave. And Ottawa police have arrested two dozen people, warning of volatile protesters. The demonstrations have disrupted everyday life for residents.
