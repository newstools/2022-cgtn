China's fourth largest freshwater lake located in the northern Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has seen its water area further expanded, its wetland ecology recovered and biodiversity improved thanks to beefed-up conservation efforts over the years. The water area of the Hulun Lake, also known as the "kidney of the grassland," expanded by 186.9 square kilometers to 2,237.5 square kilometers in 2021, said the Hulun Lake National Nature Reserve Administration in the city of Hulun Buir. The wetland ecology of the once-dwindling lake has gradually recovered and the biodiversity of the area has continued to improve, according to the administration. So far, 345 species of bird, 39 species of fish and 38 species of other animals have been recorded in the area. Since 2016, Hulun Buir has been harnessing desertified land and degraded grassland around the lake. The nature reserve has enforced grazing bans in the core grassland area. The Hulun Lake, which is on Hulun Buir Grassland, was included on a list of internationally important wetlands in 2002.
