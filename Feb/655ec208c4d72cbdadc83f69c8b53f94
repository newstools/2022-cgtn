The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) government on Wednesday said it will allocate some 47.5 billion Hong Kong dollars (about $6 billion) to help fight COVID-19 in the new financial year. Fighting COVID-19 is the top priority at present, and the HKSAR government will mobilize all available forces and resources to fight the pandemic, said Paul Chan, financial secretary of the HKSAR government, in the 2022-23 budget speech. About 22 billion Hong Kong dollars will be used to strengthen COVID-19 testing work and support the HKSAR Hospital Authority. Six billion Hong Kong dollars will go to the HKSAR Department of Health for purchasing booster vaccine doses for residents, and nearly 7 billion Hong Kong dollars will be earmarked to related departments for buying protective equipment and implementing COVID-19 preventive measures. A total of 500 million Hong Kong dollars will be allocated to the HKSAR Food and Environment Hygiene Department in two years for improving environmental hygiene services in the city. Twelve billion Hong Kong dollars will be injected into the city's anti-epidemic fund for the construction of needed facilities. In addition, Chan said another 20 billion Hong Kong dollars have been set aside for other potential anti-epidemic needs. "We will provide full support to fight the epidemic should more resources be required," he said in the speech via video link to members of the Legislative Council. Hong Kong on Wednesday reported a record 8,674 COVID-19 infections in the past 24 hours, as the city prepares for compulsory testing of its residents after authorities extended the toughest social restrictions imposed since the pandemic surged. Local health authorities reported 24 new deaths compared with Tuesday's 32, as they step up measures, with assistance from the mainland, to curb the surge. (With input from agencies)
