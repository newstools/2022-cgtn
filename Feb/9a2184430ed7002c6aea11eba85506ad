Leeds United of the Premier League announced that manager Marcelo Bielsa will step down in a statement on Sunday. "Leeds United can today confirm the club have parted company with head coach Marcelo Bielsa," the British club said. "This has been the toughest decision I have had to make during my tenure at Leeds United, taking into account all the success Marcelo has had at the club," Leeds chairman Andrea Radrizzani said. Bielsa took over the club in June 2018 and managed to lead them back to the top league in England for the first time in 16 years in his second season at Elland Road. Having finished their 38 games with 18 wins, five draws and 15 losses, Leeds were ninth on the medal table in the 2020-21 Premier League, the best for any newly promoted team since the 2000-01 season. Moreover, Bielsa's philosophy of attacking football has been excellent to watch for fans, making Leeds one of the favorite teams in the Premier League. However, the club fell into trouble in the 2021-22 season. They had only five wins after 26 games. Not only did they allow 60 goals, the most in the league, they have been struggling on offense, scoring only 28 goals. The 5-8-13 record only puts Leeds at 16th on the standings table, only two points away from the relegation area. There have been many reports about Bielsa losing his job after the 4-0 loss to Tottenham Hotspur on the road on Saturday. "I have to act in the best interest of the club and I believe a change is required now in order to secure our Premier League status. Recent results and performances have not met our expectations," Radrizzani said. Leeds revealed that the appointment of a new manager will be announced on Monday. Former Red Bull Leipzig manager Jesse Marsh is reportedly one of the major candidates for the position.
