Ottawa police say they arrested 25 people and issued 1,775 tickets on Thursday to put an end to the unlawful demonstrations in downtown areas of the Canadian capital. The police said in a statement that they had responded to nearly 1,000 calls for service concerning the protests since they began and continue to prevent people from supplying fuel and other material support to demonstrators. Trucker-led protests against coronavirus restrictions in Canada shut down another U.S. border crossing Thursday as copycat movements gathered steam as far afield as Europe and New Zealand. A second crossing in the western province of Alberta has been blocked for days, and on Thursday, protesters closed down a third – in central Manitoba. (With input from Xinhua, AFP)
