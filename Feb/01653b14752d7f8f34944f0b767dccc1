Former Greek President Christos Sartzetakis died in the early hours of Thursday at the age of 92 following a long hospitalization, according to local media. Sartzetakis served as president from March 1985 until May 1990. Born in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki in April 1929, he had studied law before joining the judiciary in 1955. He was fired from the judicial branch and arrested twice during the military rule in 1968 and eventually released in 1971 and reinstated into the judiciary in 1974. "In an atmosphere of intense political tension, his work on the formation of a government was impeccable," said Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, extending his condolences to Sartzetakis' family.
