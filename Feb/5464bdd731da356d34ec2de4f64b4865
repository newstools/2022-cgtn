Commissioner Cressida Dick, head of London's Metropolitan Police (Met), announced Thursday night she has resigned as Britain's top cop. Dick, the first woman to lead the country's largest police force, had been under pressure over a number of issues that recently generated adverse publicity for the Met. "It is clear that the Mayor no longer has sufficient confidence in my leadership to continue. He has left me no choice but to step aside as Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Service," she said in a statement.
