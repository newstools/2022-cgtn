Representatives of the European Union and the United States met again with Taliban members as the group seeks to unlock funding to weather Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis. It was the second day of talks between the Afghan delegation, led by acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, and diplomats from 16 European countries in the Qatari capital, Doha. Thomas Niklasson, EU special representative for Afghanistan, who also attended the talks, said that the bloc remains committed to delivering 500 million euros ($569m) in assistance through the UN and humanitarian organizations.
