A suspected gunman took his own life after fatally shooting two people and wounding another at an apartment complex in Brown Deer, a suburb of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on Saturday, according to local police. Brown Deer Police Chief Peter Nimmer identified the shooter as a 26-year-old male who lived in the apartment, adding that the incident appeared to be a domestic dispute in which at least two of those involved knew each other. The suspect reportedly shot himself shortly after attempting to shoot at officers. A 31-year-old man and 23-year-old woman were killed, and a 36-year-old man shot in the leg is expected to survive, the police have stated.
