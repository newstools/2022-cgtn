An impressive video footage shows Jia Jingrui from east China's Shandong Province carving the two Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics mascots, Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon, into leaves. It took Jia about six hours to finish the carving. He also carved an ancient city and some celebrity portraits into dried leaves. Jia has taught himself leaf carving over three years. "I had some basic knowledge and skills in such art work as drawing. I fell in love with leaf carving when I first saw the folk art," he recalled.
