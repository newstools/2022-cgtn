Chinese Lantern Festival is the day that wraps up the 15-day Chinese New Year celebrations. This year, the festival falls on February 15, a day after the Valentine's Day. The Lantern Festival comes with marvelous lantern displays, bowls of Yuanxiao (stuffed glutinous rice balls) and a game of riddles that can be traced back to the Han Dynasty (202 BC-AD 220). The riddles can be brain teasers, tests about Chinese characters, and also questions about fun facts. This year, let's figure out some animal riddles to join the celebrations. Think about the questions and scroll to the next picture for the answers! (All images via VCG. Designed by CGTN's Yu Peng.)
