The leaders of Germany, France and Poland have pledged unity in their goal of avoiding war on the European continent, as French President Emmanuel Macron said he sees a path forward on easing tensions between Russia and Ukraine. Tensions escalated last month, amid fears of a Russian invasion as Moscow began amassing troops at its border with Ukraine. Macron visited Moscow and Kyiv this week for talks with both Russian and Ukrainian leaders, urging continued "firm dialogue" with Russia. And Russian President Vladimir Putin said after his talks with Macron that Moscow would "do everything to find compromises that suit everyone."
