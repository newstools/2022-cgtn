China released its 'No. 1 central document' for 2022 on Tuesday, calling for continuous and "comprehensive promotion" of rural vitalization. As the first policy statement released by the government each year, the document is seen as an indicator of policy priorities. Work on agriculture, rural areas and farmers has been prioritized for 19 consecutive years since 2004. This year, the document emphasized two bottom lines: ensuring food security and preventing return to poverty, as CGTN's Guan Xin explains in this episode of BizBeat.
