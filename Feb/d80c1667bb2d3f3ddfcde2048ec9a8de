China has lodged stern representations with Japan over its so-called resolution expressing concerns about China's human rights situation, said Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Tuesday. He made the remarks after the House of Representatives of the Japanese parliament adopted a resolution on what it called the "serious human rights situation" in China, referring to the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, among others. "The so-called human rights resolution disregards the truth, maliciously denigrates China's human rights situation, seriously violates international law and basic norms governing international relations, and grossly interferes in China's internal affair," Zhao said. Noting the wars of aggression waged by Japan and the crimes committed during the wars, he said that Japan is in no position to point fingers at other countries' human rights situation. "In disregard of the overall interests of China-Japan relations, some Japanese politicians forced together the so-called resolution, which is a serious political provocation to the Chinese people," he said. China reserves the right to take further actions, he added.
