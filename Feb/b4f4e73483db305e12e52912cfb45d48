To safeguard the Charter of the United Nations, countries across the world must practice true multilateralism, stay committed to settling disputes peacefully, stay committed to win-win cooperation, and oppose hegemonic and bullying behaviors, a Chinese envoy said on Tuesday. Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the UN, made the remarks at the general debate of the 2022 session of the Special Committee on the Charter of the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. Dai called on the international community to jointly safeguard an international system with the UN at its core, an international order based on international law, and the basic norms governing international relations based on the purposes and principles of the UN Charter. The world has entered an era of changes, with global challenges in terms of peace and stability, climate change, terrorism and rising power politics, unilateralism and ideological confrontations, he said. The international community needs to firmly defend the UN Charter more than ever, he added. The UN is a big family belonging to the international community, and international rules can only be made collectively by its member states, he said. All countries should firmly support true multilateralism, he said, calling on major countries to take the lead in honoring their international commitments and contributing to world peace. Conflicts should be resolved politically through negotiation and consultations, he stressed, urging relevant countries to discard the Cold War mentality and stop stirring up confrontation between blocs. China opposes double standards on the UN Charter and the imposition of unilateral sanctions not authorized by the UN, he said. (Cover: Headquarters of the UN in New York. /CFP)
