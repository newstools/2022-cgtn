Editor's note: "Natural Facts – Q&A" answers questions on natural conditions involving winter sports. In this episode, China Meteorological Administration explains the secrets between geography and the Winter Olympics medals. The ice rink for the 2022 Olympic figure skating has witnessed both surprises and regrets. Two-time Olympic champion Japanese athlete Yuzuru Hanyu left the arena with a failed quadruple axel jump, while U.S. figure skater Nathan Chen secured his first Olympic gold with stunning free skate performance. Does the factor of weather matter to the sport? Yes, of course. Figure skating arenas depend heavily on weather conditions. A smooth ice rink and a warm venue are both needed for the event. Generally speaking, the temperature inside the venue should be around 15℃, while for the rink surface, between -5℃ to -6℃. How is the ice rink made? Of course, we need to pour water on it. Highly purified water at 50℃ is sprinkled repeatedly on the rink. With the help of coolant, a thick layer of ice is created. Why use water at 50℃ to cast ice? Poured with warm water at 50°C, the surface of the ice will melt. The warm water then cools down and ends up with very smooth and flat ice. Poured with icy water, the newly formed ice will be more brittle than that made from hot water, which is not suitable for competitions.
