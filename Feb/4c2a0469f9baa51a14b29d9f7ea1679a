A highlight of the recent Winter Olympics in Beijing is the beautiful freestyle parks at Genting Resort Secret Garden in the ski hub of Chongli. The parks have helped create a burgeoning ski market in China and pave the way for long-term and sustainable development of the country's winter sports industry. Zheng Junfeng skied down the slopes of Genting with its owner Lim Chee Wah to find out why the Malaysian businessman had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in a remote mountain some 250 kilometers northwest of Beijing over the past 15 years.
