Beijing 2022 managed to keep the competitions safe with comprehensive COVID-19 countermeasures. The daily number of positive cases reported inside the "closed loop" declined from a peak of 26 on February 2 to only one on February 19. The closed-loop system has been applied to all three competition zones: Beijing, Zhangjiakou and Yanqing. The zones include training and competition venues, Olympic villages and hotels, opening and closing ceremonies, and the medal ceremonies. And transport between them is provided by the organizers, and the vehicles are also included in the loop. Everyone is tested daily, and anyone who tests positive is isolated. When athletes are not competing, they are required to wear N95 face masks. Officials and athletes have given positive feedback on these measures and their overall experience. President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach hailed the closed-loop management as very successful. He said the closed loop was one of the safest places on the planet. U.S. freestyle skier Aaron Blunck said China has done a stellar job with COVID-19 protocols. Finland's ice hockey defenseman Sami Vatanen is also happy about his life inside the closed loop.
