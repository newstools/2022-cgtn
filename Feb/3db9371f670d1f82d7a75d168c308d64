The National Speed Skating Oval is the only newly built venue for ice competitions, and Dutch athlete Irene Schouten's Olympic record in the 3,000m christened the site in style during the first final at these Games. Nicknamed the "Ice Ribbon," the facility is hosting all of the speed skating events in which 14 gold medals are being awarded in total. The ice-making process uses one of the most advanced and energy efficient technologies available, and so far eight Olympic records and one world record have been broken at the venue with three finals remaining.
