The new cabinet led by newly-appointed Peruvian Prime Minister Hector Valer was officially sworn in on Tuesday. Valer has confirmed that he supports amending the country's market-friendly constitution, a campaign promise made by President Pedro Castillo, but that the process would take approximately four years. Peru's former prime minister resigned on Monday as President Castillo had announced a cabinet shuffle to "renew" his government team.
