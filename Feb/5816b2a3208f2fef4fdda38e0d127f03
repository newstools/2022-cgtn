On January 24, 2022, several Baer's pochards, one of the world’s most endangered bird species, were spotted on the upper course of Baisha River in Qingdao City of east China's Shandong Province. The global population of the Baer's pochard is less than 1,000. It's classified as "critically endangered" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The bird is a migratory bird, and soon it will fly northward to breed when the weather turns warmer.
