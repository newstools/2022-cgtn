The last day of the Chinese New Year celebration, the Lantern Festival is celebrated on the 15th day of the first lunar month. Aside from lanterns illuminating Chinese streets and online debates over the proper fillings for yuanxiao or tangyuan (glutinous rice balls), it is rarely recognized, even among Chinese, as the Chinese equivalent to Valentine's Day. Compared to the Qixi Festival on the seventh day of the seventh lunar month, the Lantern Festival has a relatively low profile, but it has undeniably been the day for love throughout Chinese history.
