Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn on Friday. Princess Sirindhorn arrived in Beijing on Thursday to attend Friday's opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Wang called Princess Sirindhorn a good friend of the Chinese people and welcomed her to attend the opening ceremony. China highly appreciates the Thai royal family's consistent policy of friendship with China and is willing to work together with Thailand to further improve bilateral relations, the foreign minister said. In the face of the pandemic, an event unseen in a century, China and Thailand have stuck together to overcome difficulties, Wang added, pointing out that China was the first country to provide COVID-19 vaccines to Thailand and remains the largest vaccines supplier to Thailand. China has effectively fulfilled its commitment to make vaccines a global public good and has provided more than 2.1 billion doses of vaccines to other countries, especially developing countries, the Chinese foreign minister said. "One out of every two COVID vaccines administered across the globe is made in China," Wang noted. Princess Sirindhorn, who has visited China nearly 50 times, expressed her gratitude for the country's strong support for Thailand's fight against the pandemic. "Thailand highly values Thai-Chinese exchanges and cooperation in various fields," she said.
