Editor's note: "Natural Facts – Q&A" is a special series that answers questions on natural conditions involving winter sports. In this episode, China Meteorological Administration explains how the presence of spectators affect a winter sport. Do you know that spectators cheering and applauding for the athletes could actually affect competition? But how and why? Let's see what the China Meteorological Administration has to say about it. Q: How can applause affect winter sports? A: The ice sports have special requirements for ice surface temperature, air temperature and humidity levels. For example, in curling, the playing surface needs to be kept under -5 degrees Celsius, and the humidity levels should be under 50 percent. When the game begins, the onsite personnel, whose main job is to care for the ice, must constantly monitor and account for the temperature and airflow changes caused by the cheering and applauding spectators to ensure fairness in the game. Hence, the weather monitor and prediction have to be precise during the Winter Olympics. Q: How to make sure the outdoor competition venues meet the requirements? A: The indoor sports only account for about 30 percent of all Winter Olympic Games competitions, while for outdoor ones like snowboarding and alpine skiing, the weather is less controllable. The varied landforms and elevations bring more uncertainties. Automatic weather stations have been set up to collect data and provide accurate forecasts and warnings to guide works such as when to make artificial snow or pave the terrain.
