Russia's Permanent Representative to the European Union Vladimir Chizhov refuted a statement from the Pentagon that Moscow was filming a fake video "as a pretext for invading Ukraine," RIA Novosti reported. "It's something similar to false flag operations conducted by Western countries and certain quasi NGOs in Syria some time ago, with alleged chemical attacks allegedly by the Syrian government, but in essence by their opponents. So I can assure you that Russia is never involved in any business of this kind. And no reason, logically speaking, that that might be taking place," Chizov was quoted as saying by TASS. Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said Thursday that it had evidence of a plan by Moscow to film a fake Ukrainian attack on Russians to justify a real assault on its pro-West neighbor. "We do have information that the Russians are likely to want to fabricate a pretext for an invasion," Kirby said. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov dismissed the allegation, and told TASS on Thursday that it was not the first time materials about Russia's plans to "invade" Ukraine have been published in the U.S., but nothing has followed afterwards.
