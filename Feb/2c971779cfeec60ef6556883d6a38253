A defendant charged with obstruction for his role in the Capitol riot is asking to subpoena former U.S. President Donald Trump, among others, as a trial witness. "Defendant submits that the individuals he seeks to subpoena are in exclusive possession of information relevant to this case. Moreover, their testimony is necessary to ensure that Defendant's constitutional right to present a complete defense is safeguarded," attorney Samuel Shamansky submitted in court filings on behalf of his client, Dustin Thompson.
