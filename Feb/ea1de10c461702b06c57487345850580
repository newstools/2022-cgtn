The opening ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games was broadcast on Friday, presenting a visual feast of ice and snow to the world. China Media Group (CMG) employees worked behind the scenes to ensure the event ran smoothly. Yu Lei, chief director of CMG's "National Treasure" TV program, also served as the chief literary writer for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Winter Olympics. After the opening ceremony, she immediately began preparing for the closing ceremony. Her computer holds more than 600 files recording the process of the team's creative ideas over the past three years, CMG reported. "We incorporated rich expressions in it, including Chinese emotions, Chinese philosophy, history, and our attitude toward nature and the world," said Yu, adding that she feels lucky to have CMG's full support. At the opening ceremony, the broadcast control system, AR system and rendering system were fully supported by the Technology Bureau of CMG. The performance area of the show featured a nearly 16K LED display screen, marking a first in China. In another first, the stage's LED image adopted a frame rate of 50 frames per second.
