Turkish warplanes have carried out strikes against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq and Syria, the Turkish defense ministry said on Wednesday, with authorities in Iraq's autonomous Kurdish region reporting "casualties." Turkish warplanes "targeted several positions of Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) fighters" on Tuesday, including in the Makhmur and Sinjar regions, Kurdish forces said, without specifying the number of dead or wounded.
