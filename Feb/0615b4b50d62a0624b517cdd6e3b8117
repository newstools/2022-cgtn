International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach on Sunday night gave a thumbs up to the athletes of Beijing 2022 and called for world leaders to follow their example of solidarity and peace. Bach made the remarks before he declared the close of the 24th Winter Olympic Games at a ceremony at the iconic Bird's Nest stadium in Beijing. Athletes from countries that are divided by conflict have respected, supported and embraced each other over the past 16 days, he said. "You overcame these divisions, demonstrating that in this Olympic community we are all equal – regardless of what we look like, where we come from, or what we believe in," Bach said. "This unifying power of the Olympic Games is stronger than the forces that want to divide us: you give peace a chance," said the IOC chief, calling on political leaders around the world to follow the athletes' example. He called on humanity to beat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic by practicing the new Olympic motto. "If we want to finally overcome this pandemic, we must be faster, we must aim higher, we must be stronger – we must stand together." Bach also paid tribute to volunteers and the "gracious" Chinese people as hosts. The IOC on Saturday awarded the Olympic Cup to the Chinese people in recognition of their support for the Games.
