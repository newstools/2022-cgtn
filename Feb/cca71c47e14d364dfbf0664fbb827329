In south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, officials in Baise city say they have a sufficient inventory of food and medical items as the region battles a COVID-19 outbreak. However, some families have reported shortages of baby supplies, such as diapers and infant formula. Most cases have been detected in Baise's Debao County, where the Women's Federation said it has been doing grocery runs for affected households to ensure their needs are met. Guangxi reported 30 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases on February 11, all in the city of Baise. This brings the region's tally of local transmissions to 250 in its latest COVID-19 resurgence.
