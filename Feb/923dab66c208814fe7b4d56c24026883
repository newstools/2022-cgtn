The National Speed Skating Oval, nicknamed "Ice Ribbon," is a new venue built for ice competitions at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The venue will host all the speed skating events for 14 gold medals. It covers an area of 12,000 square meters and features the largest single-piece ice formation in Asia. The ice-making process uses one of the most advanced and energy-efficient technologies to create safer, smoother and faster skating experiences. As part of the city's sustainability efforts to reuse venues from the 2008 Summer Olympics, the National Speed Skating Oval is one of only two newly built competition venues for the winter edition of the Games.
