National Aquatic Center, better known as the "Water Cube," is one of the iconic venues from the Beijing 2008 Summer Olympics. The venue was repurposed for Beijing 2022 and transformed into the "Ice Cube" for curling competitions. Curling is the longest running competition at the Winter Olympics and now that the mixed doubles finished on Tuesday, the first round of the men's competition starts Wednesday with four matches, including China facing PyeongChang 2018 silver medalists Sweden.
