President Umaro Sissoco Embalo of Guinea-Bissau held a press conference at the presidential palace on Tuesday after a failed coup attempt to announce that several civilians and soldiers "have already been arrested after this attempted putsch." Embalo was accompanied by Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam and members of the government, claiming that "the actors are known by the security services because they are being prosecuted for drug trafficking in Guinea-Bissau. This is an isolated act carried out by a group of traffickers in the country." Embalo also reiterated his commitment to continue fighting drug traffickers in Guinea-Bissau.
