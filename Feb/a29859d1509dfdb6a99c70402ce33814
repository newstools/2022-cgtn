Virgin Galactic is re-opening ticket sales for upcoming space travel to the general public from February 16, said billionaire Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic Holdings Inc. on Tuesday, driving its shares more than 10 percent higher in pre-market trading. The tickets are priced at $450,000 each, including an initial deposit of $150,000. The spaceflight reservations also include access to the Future Astronaut community, which will provide members access to events, trips and space-readiness activities before their trip. "We plan to have our first 1,000 customers on board at the start of commercial service later this year," Virgin Galactic Chief Executive Officer Michael Colglazier said in a statement. Shares of Virgin Galactic have fallen 66 percent since last October, when the company delayed its commercial space travel service to the fourth quarter of 2022. A handful of companies including Elon Musk's SpaceX and Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin are striving to make space tourism a reality, and some have already launched civilian missions.
