Russian S-400 "Triumf" surface-to-air missile systems have deployed to Belarus and will go on air defense combat alert as part of an inspection of the Union State's Response Force for the Union Resolve 2022 joint drills, Russia's Defense Ministry reported on Thursday. "S-400 'Triumf' anti-aircraft missile systems of the Eastern Military District's Air Force and Air Defense Army involved in an inspection of the Union State's Response Force have arrived in Belarus," the ministry said. As the Russian Defense Ministry reported, during the Union Resolve 2022 Russia-Belarus joint drills, the troops will practice reinforcing state border sections in potential areas of the illegal penetration of armed gangs into the territory of Belarus. Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko announced his intention to buy all of the equipment from Russia, especially SU-35 fighter jets and S-400 air defense systems, to take part in the joint drills. Belarus is also preparing to set up a new joint training and combat center with Russia to develop the latest weapons, Lukashenko said.
