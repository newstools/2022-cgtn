After winning silver in the slopestyle, Su Yiming will next compete in the big air on February 15. The man from Jilin has created history twice in succession. First, he became the first Chinese to land a backside triple cork 1620 in March 2020. The following January, he became the first Chinese to complete a Cab 1800 and in October, he became the first snowboarder in the world to land a backside 1980 Indy Crail when he was training in Stubai, Austria, which saw him recognized by Guinness World Records. Two months later, the 17-year-old became the first Chinese to win a men's big air World Cup title at Steamboat.
