China's Su Yiming grabbed gold earlier today in the men's big air. The victory gives the 17-year-old another spot in the history books, following a series of breakthroughs in the run-up to the Winter Games. The Jilin resident was the first Chinese to complete a backside triple cork 1620, land a Cab 1800, and claim a men's big air World Cup title. Su was also the first snowboarder from anywhere to perform a backside 1980 Indy Crail, but now he's given himself the best possible birthday present just three days before he turns 18 after winning the big air final in Beijing to earn his first Olympic gold medal.
