Jerome Powell will become interim Federal Reserve chair on Saturday, ensuring continuity in leadership at the U.S. central bank while his renomination by U.S. President Joe Biden awaits Senate action. "The Federal Reserve Board on Friday named Jerome H. Powell as Chair Pro Tempore, pending Senate confirmation to a second term as Chair of the Board of Governors," the Fed said in a statement Friday. "The action, effective February 5, enables him to continue to carry out his duties as Chair after the expiration of his term on the same day, and while the confirmation process is underway."
