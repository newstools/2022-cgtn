Migratory whooper swans have arrived in the wetlands of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region for a stopover en route to the Indian subcontinent. More than 300 whooper swans landed at Manas National Wetland Park during the Spring Festival holiday from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6. In recent years, the wetland has become a popular wintering habitat for birds amid conservation efforts. Researchers identified one returning guest among the flock – a banded whooper swan with the series number "1T11". Bird banding is a common practice for studying and identifying individual birds. Researchers said "1T11" has been spotted in the Manas wetland park for nine consecutive years. "This fully shows the Manas National Wetland Park is an ideal habitat for whooper swans to stop over in winter. The monitoring can help solve the puzzles of whooper swans' migratory routes and life habits, providing scientific basis for us to better protect the swans," said Liu Yongjun, who heads the management team at the wetland park.
