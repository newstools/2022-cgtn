China's winter sports athletes are turning to high-tech facilities and advanced approaches in their preparations for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The national ski jumping squad has moved from Beidahu in Jilin Province to Laiyuan in Hebei Province, which provides a ski jump platform, wind tunnel and other physical training facilities. Meanwhile, the national ski team has used a ski simulator developed by China-based company Sky Tech Sport to enhance athletes' performance, as the tech-aided sport equipment has undergone successful runs at both the 2014 Sochi and 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympic Games.
