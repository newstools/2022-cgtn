U.S. President Joe Biden's national security team has provided intelligence reports about a potential Ukraine crisis, including satellite pictures showing the organized advance of Russian forces toward the border since last October, The New York Times reported on Monday. Biden sent a message to Russian President Vladimir Putin through CIA Director William Burns to advise him that Washington had access to this intelligence, according to the report. Biden also approved an unprecedented media campaign against Putin with the support of his top intelligence officials, according to Times interviews with more than a dozen senior administration officials.
