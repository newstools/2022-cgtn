Heavy snowfall has created a picturesque landscape at the snow-capped Maiji Mountain Grottoes, a world heritage site located in northwest China's Gansu Province. The Maiji Mountain Grottoes feature 221 caves for more than 10,000 clay sculptures that were created as far back as 1,600 years ago and are collectively known as the "Oriental Sculpture Museum."
