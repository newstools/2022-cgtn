The United States will deploy a guided missile destroyer and state-of-the-art fighter jets to help defend the United Arab Emirates after a series of missile attacks by Yemeni rebels, a U.S. statement said Wednesday. The deployment "to assist the UAE against the current threat" follows a phone call between U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, according to the U.S. embassy in the UAE.
