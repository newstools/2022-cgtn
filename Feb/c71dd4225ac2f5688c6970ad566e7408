Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank gathered at a funeral march for three men killed by Israeli security forces. Israel's domestic security service said the three Palestinians killed in their car on Tuesday were members of a terrorist squad. The Israel Security Agency said the three men were responsible for several shooting attacks against Israeli soldiers and civilians in the area over the past few weeks. They added that there were no casualties from these attacks. The armed wing of the Palestinian Fatah group claimed the three men as its members. The Palestinian foreign ministry has condemned the killing as a "field execution."
