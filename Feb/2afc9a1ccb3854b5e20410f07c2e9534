Chinese athletes will attend all six sports at the 2022 Winter Paralympic Games, according to Yong Zhijun, deputy director of the sports department of the China Disabled Persons' Federation, during a press conference on Sunday. The 2022 Paralympic Winter Games will be held across three competition zones -central Beijing, Beijing's Yanqing District and Zhangjiakou City in Hebei Province, from March 4 to 13, featuring a total 78 events in six sports. The official roster of Team China for the Winter Paralympics will be announced on Monday. According to Yong, winter sports among Chinese Paralympic athletes grew rapidly in the past few years in terms of participation and achievements. China saw a surge of winter Paralympic athletes since 2016, as the number grew from about 50 to around 1,000. In the PyeongChang Winter Paralympics, the curling team clinched China's first ever gold medal in Winter Paralympics history. Chinese Paralympians are in their final preparations before the Games start on March 4. (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
