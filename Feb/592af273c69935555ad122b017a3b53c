The NBA was shocked when the Brooklyn Nets and the Philadelphia 76ers reached a deal to exchange James Harden and Ben Simmons less than two hours before the trade deadline. Simmons has not played one game for the 76ers this season, while Harden has been struggling with the Nets. Departure could bring relief and new opportunities for both of them. The Nets could enhance their defense with Simmons and Andre Drummond, and Seth Curry should be a great help in stretching the floor. As for the 76ers, ESPN NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins said the Harden-Joel Embiid duo could be "the next version of Kobe and Shaq." So, who won in this blockbuster deal?
