China's Hualong One, a domestically designed third-generation nuclear reactor, has been confirmed adequate for use in Britain, said the designer, China General Nuclear Power Corporation (CGN), on Monday. The reactor has met the standard of the Generic Design Assessment (GDA), according to a joint statement issued on Monday by the British Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and the Environment Agency (EA). Before being put into use, the new technology must pass the assessment led by the ONR and the EA to determine its safety and environmental impact. ONR has issued a Design Acceptance Confirmation (DAC) and the EA has issued a Statement of Design Acceptability to Hualong One. The CGN and French state-owned power giant EDF signed deals with the British government in September 2016 on building three projects in Britain. The project, based in Bradwell, Essex, is expected to use the Hualong One technology. Read more: World's 3rd nuclear reactor with Hualong One tech connected to grid
