Tunisian President Kais Saied said on Thursday the dissolved Superior Council of the Judiciary will be replaced by a provisional body pending the establishment of a new council. Dozens of judges took to the streets of the capital Tunis to protest against the planned dissolution. The council is one of the last remaining institutions in the country able to work independently from the president. Saied initially announced on Sunday that he would dissolve the judicial watchdog.
