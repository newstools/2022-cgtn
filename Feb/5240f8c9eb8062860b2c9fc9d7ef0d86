The United Nations Security Council failed to pass a draft resolution on the Ukraine-Russia crisis on Friday. The draft, proposed by the United States and Albania, was rejected because it was vetoed by permanent member Russia. Any negative vote, known as a veto, from the council's five permanent members means a failed resolution. China, India and the UAE abstained.
