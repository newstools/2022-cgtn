The Grand Canyon National Park in Arizona state is the 15th place in the United States to have been listed as a national park. The magnificent layers of colorful rocks in the Grand Canyon have recorded the geological changes over billions of years. The canyon was created by the erosion of the Colorado River and its tributaries after the Colorado Plateau was uplifted. You can visit the park from the South Rim and North Rim. The altitude of North Rim is higher than the South Rim, thus it is closed from December to next May. Most people choose to come to the South Rim because it is open through all seasons and the transportation is very convenient. (All photos taken by Wan Hailun.)
