Sand, water and reeds accompanied by the warm winter sun! What a perfect winter scene! Icebreakers sail day and night, churning fresh oxygen for the aquatic creatures below. Our team of reporters is floating on Sand Lake, which is home to more than 33 species of fish, with migratory birds gliding overhead. The winter scenery is just as beautiful as the spring's!
