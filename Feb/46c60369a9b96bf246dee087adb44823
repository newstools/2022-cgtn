Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Friday said the city will take more drastic measures to contain the latest outbreak of the coronavirus, including rolling out mass testing and setting up temporary quarantine facilities. "The Chinese mainland is coming to our aid and we will be building quarantine facilities or 'temporary hospitals.' These are all support from the central authorities that are helping to improve our performance in all aspects in such a short time," Lam said at a press conference. Hong Kong is currently facing its toughest ever situation in over two years of battling COVID-19. Lam said the election for the chief executive of the HKSAR will be postponed to May 8 due to the COVID-19 epidemic.
