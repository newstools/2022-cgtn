U.S. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz urged Moscow on Wednesday to take real steps to defuse tensions, as they warned that no significant withdrawal of Russian troops from the Ukrainian border had been observed thus far. "The risk of a further military aggression by Russia against Ukraine remains high, utmost caution is required," read a statement issued by the German chancellery following a phone call between Scholz and Biden.
