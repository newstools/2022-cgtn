Russia's defense ministry published a video on Wednesday showing a column of tanks and military vehicles leaving Crimea across a railway bridge after completing drills in the region. It added that some troops would return to their permanent bases. The video came a day after Russia announced a first troop pullback from Ukraine's borders. "Units of the Southern Military District, having completed their participation in tactical exercises, are moving to their permanent deployment points," Moscow's defense ministry said in a statement, as state television showed images of military units crossing a bridge linking the Russian-controlled peninsula to the mainland. Special trains will deliver the military hardware to the regions where the troops are permanently stationed, in particular, in Dagestan and North Ossetia. Upon arrival at their permanent bases, the troops will carry out maintenance of their equipment, TASS news agency reported, citing the military. The tactical drills ran at 15 combined arms practice ranges. They involved reinforced companies of battalion tactical groups, according to the TASS.
