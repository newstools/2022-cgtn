A senior leader of the Communist Party of China (CPC) on Monday called on Taiwan compatriots to realize that China's reunification is a historical trend. Wang Yang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks in Beijing at a virtual meeting with Wu Cheng-tien, chairman of Taiwan's New Party. Wu attended the closing ceremony of the Beijing Winter Olympics on Sunday. Wang hailed the New Party's long-held stance of supporting reunification and opposing "Taiwan independence." He urged Taiwan compatriots to resolutely oppose separatist attempts in seeking "Taiwan independence" and interference by external forces, calling for efforts to shore up a strong front for opposing "independence" and promoting reunification. He said Beijing 2022 was a home event for all Chinese people and that the success of the Games is a glory belonging to the whole nation. Taiwan compatriots took part in the Games in various forms, he noted, adding that Taiwan compatriots cannot and will not be absent from the Chinese nation's journey toward rejuvenation. Wu said reunification of the two sides across the Taiwan Straits is an unstoppable trend of history, calling on the two sides to strive for peaceful reunification through exchanges, integration, dialogue and communication. The Chinese Taipei delegation comprising 17 members attended the Beijing Winter Olympics, including four athletes who competed in speed skating, alpine skiing and luge as well as a replacement athlete, according to the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. Five compatriots from Taiwan participated in the torch relay, and over 30 Taiwan students studying in universities in Beijing were engaged in voluntary work for the Games.
