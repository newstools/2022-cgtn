China will do its best to protect the legal rights and personal safety of its overseas citizens, Chinese Foreign Ministry's spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Friday, responding to media reports that a Chinese student was beaten up in South Korea's Pusan. Zhao mentioned that the Chinese consulate-general in Pusan had contacted the concerned person and provided active assistance. He further added that the consulate-general also coordinated with local police to open an investigation into the case and would continue to follow up. Media report first emerged on Wednesday after a Chinese student in Pusan was reportedly assaulted by two South Koreans after hearing the student speaking Chinese.
