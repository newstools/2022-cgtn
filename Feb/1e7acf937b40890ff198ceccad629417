The African Union (AU) has condemned a recent "wave" of coups that has seen an unprecedented number of member states suspended from the bloc, a senior official said on Sunday. "Every African leader in the assembly has condemned unequivocally ... the wave of unconstitutional changes of government," Bankole Adeoye, head of the AU's security body, told a press conference on the closing day of the 55-member body's annual summit.
