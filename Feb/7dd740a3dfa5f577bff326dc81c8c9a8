ASML Holding NV, a key supplier to computer chip makers, is examining alternative sources for the small amount of neon it uses in its factories in case a conflict between Russia and Ukraine disrupts supplies. Although Ukraine is the world's biggest producer of neon, ASML sources less than 20 percent of the gas from it uses from those countries, a spokesperson said on Wednesday. Neon is a key material used in the gas-phase lasers used in chip-making, and prices soared during the Russia-Ukraine conflict in 2014. Most of the world's semiconductors are manufactured in Asia, where ASML had 85 percent of its sales in 2021. The company's key customers include TSMC, Samsung and Intel.
