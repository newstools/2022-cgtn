China will continue to keep coal prices stable, the country's top economic planner and energy department have said. The National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration held a meeting on Wednesday to make further plans to stabilize coal prices. The meeting issued warnings to companies that charged exorbitant prices and asked them to make rectifications. Coal producers were also told to step up efforts to ensure supplies. Those that fail to rectify any outstanding problems after being issued reminders will be subject to further investigation and accountability measures, the meeting said. Officials also decided that local authorities should enhance their monitoring and maintain prices in a reasonable range.
