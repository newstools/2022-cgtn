The expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in its geographical scope, range of operations, and engagement in bloc politics and confrontation is not conducive to global security and stability, a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU said on Tuesday. The spokesperson's remarks came after NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg's comments on Monday about a joint China-Russia statement that called on the organization to stop admitting new members. Referring to Stoltenberg's statement that the call is an attempt to deny sovereign nations the right to make their own choices, the spokesperson said China believes that regional security should not be guaranteed by strengthening or expanding military blocs. "We call on NATO to abandon the Cold War mentality and ideological bias, respect the sovereignty, security, interests, as well as the diversity of civilizations, history and culture of other countries," the spokesperson said.
