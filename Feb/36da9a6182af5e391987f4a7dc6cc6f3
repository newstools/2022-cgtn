On Tuesday, Olympic volunteers partook in Lantern Festival fun at the Main Media Center in Beijing. They worked on decorations like pendants, paper-cuttings, clay sculptures and lanterns that come in various patterns. Some even made a plasticine figurine of Bing Dwen Dwen, the popular official mascot of the Games. The volunteers also took part in traditional Lantern Festival activities like the pitch-pot game and riddle-writing, which is believed to bring good luck.
