The public transportation system for the Zhangjiakou Competition Zone started to run on Friday. There are 88 low-deck buses and welcabs prepared for the upcoming Paralympics, which can accommodate 72 wheelchair athletes at one time. The bus team has organized volunteers' training with 46 volunteers helping athletes get on and off the buses across multiple stations. The team has also made targeted improvements on the buses' accessible facilities. "According to the bus shape, we designed an extended woody board. The gentle incline will allow athletes to move their wheelchairs onto the bus by themselves. During the Games, the bus schedule is based on athletes' training, competition and team meetings. Buses will run every ten minutes three hours ahead and behind the competitions, which will fully meet the transportation requirements," Rui Yongqiang, Zhangjiakou Competition Zone Bus general director said.
