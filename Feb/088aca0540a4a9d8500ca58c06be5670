A pair of whooper swans share an intimate moment at Yinghua Lake, Rongcheng City in east China's Shandong Province on February 22, 2022. Whooper swans are monogamous birds and form pairs for life. They are known for their courtship ritual of touching beaks, which sees them form a heart shape with their slender necks. Located in the easternmost tip of the Shandong Peninsula, Rongcheng is an important relay station for the southward migration of whooper swans. About 10,000 of them fly in from Siberia and other regions every winter. They migrate back when the weather turns warmer in spring.
