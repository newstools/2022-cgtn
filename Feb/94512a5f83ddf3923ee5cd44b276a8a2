The African Union (AU) has suspended a debate on whether to withdraw Israel's accreditation, according to media reports. "The Israel question has been suspended for now and instead there will be a committee set up to study the issue," one of the diplomats told AFP new agency on the closing day of the AU's annual summit in Addis Ababa. The Jerusalem Post reported the vote to revoke Israel's observer status at the AU was deferred for a year. The committee is meant to review Israel's status and submit its conclusion to next year's AU Executive Council, the Jerusalem Post said. The AU Executive Council convened in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa on Thursday, with heads of state in attendance. Chairperson of the AU Commission Moussa Faki Mahamat received credentials from Israel's ambassador last July, granting Israel observer status at the AU. Israel previously held observer status at the predecessor Organization of African Unity until 2002, when the organization was dissolved and became the AU. Israel's foreign ministry had said the acceptance to the AU as an observer is in the interest of Israel, the AU and of its members which will allow increased cooperation between Israel and African states. But several African countries have expressed objection to the decision ever since, citing the human rights of Palestinian people in Israel. (With input from agencies)
