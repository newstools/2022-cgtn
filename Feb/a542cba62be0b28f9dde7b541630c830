A passenger was found alive aboard a ferry that has been ablaze off Greece for three days on Sunday, although 11 people are still missing, AFP reported, citing a coast guard official. The fire broke out on the Italian-flagged Euroferry Olympia late on Thursday as it sailed from Igoumenitsa in Greece to Brindisi in Italy with 290 people aboard. Rescuers managed to save 278 passengers from the blaze on Friday.
