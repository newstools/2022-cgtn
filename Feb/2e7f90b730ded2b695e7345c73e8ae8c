Mali's army-led government on Friday asked France to withdraw its troops from the Sahel state "without delay," calling into question Paris' plans to pull out over several months, according to Reuters. A government spokesman added in a statement announced on public television that the results of France's nine-year military engagement in conflict-torn Mali were "not satisfactory."
