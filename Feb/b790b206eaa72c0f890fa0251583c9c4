In a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Moscow, French President Emmanuel Macron said Monday he hoped to make a start towards a de-escalation of tensions over Ukraine. "This discussion can make a start in the direction in which we need to go, which is towards a de-escalation," Macron said, calling for "an answer that is useful for both Russia and for all the rest of Europe." Welcoming Macron as "dear Emmanuel," Putin said Russia and France have "shared concerns regarding security in Europe" and hailed "how much effort the current French leadership is making" to resolve these concerns.
