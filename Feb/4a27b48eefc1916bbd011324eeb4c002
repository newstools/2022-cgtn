The Belarusian Central Election Commission (CEC) announced on Monday that 65.16 percent of citizens voted for constitutional amendments at the referendum, according to RIA News Agency. The voting was held on Sunday and the referendum will be considered valid if more than half of the eligible voters cast their ballots. On January 20, Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko signed a decree calling for a referendum on amending the constitution. The draft of the new constitution states that the All-Belarusian People's Assembly will become the highest representative power in Belarus. In addition, the clauses on the "non-nuclear" and "neutral" status of Belarus have been removed from the new draft. (With input from Xinhua and Reuters)
