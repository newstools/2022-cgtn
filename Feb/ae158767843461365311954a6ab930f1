Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei said on Thursday that it will further develop peaceful nuclear capacities to preserve the country's independence, amid talks between it and world powers to revive a 2015 nuclear pact. Khamenei said Iran has never sought nuclear weapons, as what he referred to as the Islamic Republic's "enemies" have alleged.
