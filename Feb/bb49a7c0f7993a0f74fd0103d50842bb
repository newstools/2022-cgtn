The National Aquatic Center, one of the iconic venues from Beijing's 2008 Summer Olympics is better known as the Water Cube. The venue was repurposed for Beijing 2022 winter Olympics and transformed into the Ice Cube to stage curling competitions. Inside Ice Cube are four sheets of ice which allows up to four matches to take place simultaneously. On Friday morning, China edged Denmark 5-4 to claim their first win in three round robin games at the Water Cube. Neither Denmark nor China have managed to get any wins in the event yet. After opening with losses to Sweden and the Russian Olympic Committee, China knocked Denmark's only red stone out of the house to clinch the 5-4 win in the 10th end. With their first victory, China move up to 7th place in the round robin ranking, and the home rink will try to claim a second straight win when they face Italy on Saturday afternoon.
