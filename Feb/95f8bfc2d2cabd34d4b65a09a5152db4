Beijing 2022 is the second Winter Olympics for South Korean figure skater Cha Jun-hwan, who came fifth in the men's final at the Capital Indoor Stadium. The 20-year-old is coached by Canadian legend Brian Orser, as is Japan's Yuzuru Hanyu, and he sat down with CGTN Sports Scene's Zhu Mandan to share his experience at these Games.
