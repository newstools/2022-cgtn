Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdolahian said on Saturday that Washington should provide guarantees for the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal, Reuters reported. Ali Shamkhani, Secretary of Iran's Supreme National Security Council, ruled out any restriction on the country's legal right to press on with its peaceful nuclear program. He tweeted that “Iran's legal right to continue research and development and to maintain its peaceful nuclear capabilities and achievements, along with its security against supported evils, cannot be restricted by any agreement.” Ali Shamkhani made the remarks after the Biden administration restored a sanctions waiver that allows cooperation with Tehran on civil nuclear projects.
