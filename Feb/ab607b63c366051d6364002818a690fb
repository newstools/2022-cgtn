Sitting on an icebreaker as it makes its way across the Sand Lake, the "warm pot" laid on the table in the middle of the boat sends delicious smells and wafts of heat upwards. Jingyuan County beef and Yanchi County lamb … countless dishes are laid out on the table, waiting for people to taste and learn the history behind. Visitors relax and admire the scenery as they enjoy the food in the sunshine. This is definitely one of the best experiences Ningxia has to offer.
