Russian figure skater Kamila Valieva has tested positive for the banned substance trimetazidine in a sample collected in December, the International Testing Agency (ITA) said on Friday. The sample returned positive on February 8, the ITA said. The Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA) on February 9 lifted a provisional suspension on Valieva after a challenge from the skater. The ITA said it will lead an appeal on behalf of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) against RUSADA's decision, which will decide the 15-year-old athlete's right to compete in the women's singles event at the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. The IOC on Thursday said the unspecified legal issue that postponed the medal ceremony for the figure skating team event at Beijing 2022 was still under investigation, and asked for "patience and understanding of all the athletes involved."
