A Golden snub-nosed monkey family enjoys the snow in Pingwu County, Sichuan Province in southwest China. The Golden snub-nosed monkey is endemic to several provinces in central, northwest and southwest China. Sichuan Province is the primary habitat of the rare species. Therefore, it is also named Sichuan snub-nosed monkey. The beautiful primate is one of China's "national treasure" animals, just like the giant panda. CGTN Nature made mini documentary series to introduce golden snub-nosed monkeys and people's endeavor to protect them to the world. Check out the links below for our videos.
