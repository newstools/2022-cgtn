China's Commerce Ministry on Friday said China always upholds the multilateral trading system and will resolutely safeguard its own legitimate rights and interest, after the EU said it has launched a legal challenge against China at the World Trade Organization (WTO) over tech patents. "China strictly follows the WTO rules and its accession commitments, and continuously improves the legislation and enforcement of intellectual property protection," a Commerce Ministry official said, adding that China regretted the EU's legal challenge and will handle follow-up matters in accordance with WTO rules.
