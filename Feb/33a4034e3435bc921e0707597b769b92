The CGTN-produced documentary "One Dream" has been broadcast in China, Canada and Europe to celebrate the Winter Olympics. "OneDream," a 60-minute feature accompanied by a series of short videos, follows six aspiring young athletes – figure skaters, hockey players and speed skaters – from China and Canada as they learn about each other's culture and lifestyle and discover they are united by the shared goal of one day competing together on the global stage.
