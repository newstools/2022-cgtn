Three crew members on board a Nigerian oil production vessel that exploded and sank last week have been found alive while seven are still missing, the ship's operator has revealed. The Nigerian FPSO Trinity Spirit, a floating production, storage and offloading vessel, caught fire following an explosion on Wednesday, but the blaze was extinguished a day later.
