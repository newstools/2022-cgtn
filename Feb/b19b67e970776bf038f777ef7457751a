The 2021-22 UEFA Champions League came back this week with four Round of 16 first-leg games. Though they were playing on the road, Manchester City smashed Sporting CP 5-0 at Estadio Jose Alvalade. For the first time in years, Paris Saint-Germain beat strong opponents in both the result and the process after the 1-0 win over Real Madrid at Parc des Princes. Bayern Munich would have been upset by Red Bull Saltsburg at Red Bull Arena if it weren't for the 90th-minute goal by Kingsley Coman to make it 1-1. Liverpool beat Inter Milan 2-0 at Stadio Giuseppe Meazza, but the Nerazzurri have caused enough trouble for the Reds.
