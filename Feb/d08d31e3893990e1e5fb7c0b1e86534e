The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on Wednesday warned that a potential trucker convoy protest against vaccine mandates could begin on February 13, threatening to disturb the Super Bowl or the State of the Union address. According to senior law enforcement officials and documents, the warning issued on Tuesday by DHS states that the agency "has received reports of a convoy of truckers planning to potentially block roads in major metropolitan cities in the United States in protest of, among other things, vaccine mandates for truck drivers."
