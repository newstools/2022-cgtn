Genting Snow Park has two separate venues, one for freestyle skiing and another for snowboarding, each of which can accommodate 7,500 spectators. The Park features six courses and one of those is the halfpipe, where on Thursday morning reigning champion Chloe Kim of the United States successfully defended her title in the women's snowboard halfpipe with her first run of the final.
