China and Russia signed an Authorized Economic Operator (AEO) Mutual Recognition Arrangement on Friday in order to better facilitate their customs cooperations and trade relations, according to China's General Administration of Customs. The AEO system, initiated by the World Customs Organization, is designed to facilitate customs clearances for enterprises deemed to have a high level of law compliance, credit status and safety. Companies will enjoy simplified customs procedures, such as reduced examination and prioritized clearance, when they export products to the other country under the agreement. The agreement between China and Russia is set to further facilitate the security and efficiency of supply chains between the two countries and create a safer and more convenient environment for them in consolidating the foundations of energy cooperation and continued growth of trade and investment.
