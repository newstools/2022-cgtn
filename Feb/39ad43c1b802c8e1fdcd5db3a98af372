Russia has expelled senior U.S. diplomat Bart Gorman from Moscow. The Russian Foreign Ministry says the move is a response to an earlier expulsion of a Russian diplomat from Washington. Meanwhile, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov says accusations of Russia's continued military buildup at its border with Ukraine are baseless. Moscow has announced two-separate pull-backs. The Kremlin also criticized Western officials for commenting on Russia's domestic military drills.
