China is confident and capable of realizing steady, sound and sustainable economic development in the face of a grave and complex external environment, an official with the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) said recently. Although China is faced with "triple pressure" – shrinking demand, supply shocks and weakening expectations, there are still some positive conditions that support China's development, Xinhua reported on Saturday, quoting an official from China's top planner NDRC without specifying the name. China's growing national power and comprehensive industrial system improved the country's capacity to tackle with risks and challenges, said the official. Meanwhile, strong domestic market and potential of consumption growth, as well as urbanization, will be driving forces for further growth, the official said. In terms of policy support, there are still room for macro-policies and tools to keep the economy stable, the official said.
