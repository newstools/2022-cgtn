The International Skating Union (ISU) issued a statement on its official website on Tuesday, ruling against the two appeals from the South Korean team and Team Hungary for the yellow cards they received during the Beijing 2022 short track speed skate men's 1,000m semifinal and final, respectively, on Monday. China's Ren Ziwei won the final after the referees gave Hungarian Liu Shaolin Sandor a yellow card for two penalties, described as "in the straight lane change from inside to out causing contact," and "arm block at the finish." The protest from Team South Korea was also overruled, as the ISU stated that Hwang Daeheon received his penalty for "illegal late pass causing contact" in the semifinal round.
