China will further optimize the list of imported retail goods for cross-border e-commerce starting from March 1, the Ministry of Finance said. The list will add a total of 29 product categories, including ski equipment, tomato juice and golf equipment, according to a statement jointly issued by the ministry and seven other departments on Monday. All the items included in the list are in high demand by consumers in recent years, said Gao Lingyun, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. "The adjustment could enrich domestic market supply, meet consumers' aspirations for a better life and provide more opportunities for overseas enterprises," Gao said. Issued in April 2016, the list has been optimized several times, and its commodity categories kept increasing, which helped promote the development of cross-border e-commerce and high-quality trade, said Tian Guofeng, deputy secretary-general of China Association of Trade in Services
