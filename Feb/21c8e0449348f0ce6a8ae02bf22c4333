Strict COVID-19 prevention and control measures were put in place throughout the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games. According to CGTN reporter Cen Ziyuan, the badges were scanned to comply with the protocol of getting tested for coronavirus every 24 hours. Once someone failed to do so, relevant officials would get an alert, and they would be asked to stay in the hotel until their next test result came out.
