Lebanon has thwarted three potential bombings being planned by Islamic State militants against Shiite places of worship in Beirut's southern suburbs, AFP reported on Wednesday, citing the Interior Ministry. "Three separate targets were to be hit at the same time," the ministry said, in an operation that Lebanese Interior Minister Bassam Mawlawi said would have caused a large loss of life.
