A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Wednesday warned of decisive measures if "Taiwan independence" separatist forces misjudge the situation and make risky moves that touch the "red line." Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks after recent comments from the Taiwan region that suggest "drawing up a constitution" or "amending a constitution" to seek "independence." He also reiterated that the mainland firmly opposes any plots that seek "Taiwan independence." Commenting on former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's planned visit to Taiwan next week, Ma slammed the United States for attempting to obstruct China's reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation by playing the "Taiwan card." Pompeo's visit is a "farce," Ma said. The root cause to the lasting tensions across the Taiwan Straits is attempts by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority to seek "Taiwan independence" by relying on the U.S. and attempts by some Americans to use Taiwan to contain China, he added. No matter how the DPP authority and external forces collude with each other, they cannot change the fact that Taiwan is part of China, nor can they obstruct the historical trend of China's reunification and the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, he stressed. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin also criticized Pompeo's planned visit on Monday. Wang warned that the DPP authority is "playing with fire and will end up being consumed by it." (Cover: File photo of Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. /CFP)
