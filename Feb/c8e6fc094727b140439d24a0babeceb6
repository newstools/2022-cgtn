Guido Rosler was no less thrilled than any Beijinger on the evening of July 13, 2001, when Beijing successfully won the bid for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. At that time he was a German student at Beijing Language and Cultural University. He started a campaign to collect signatures from foreigners who live, work and travel in Beijing in order to show their support for China to host the Games. He married to a Chinese wife and has four children. They expressed their wish for the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics.
