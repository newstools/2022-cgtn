Paris 2024 chief Tony Estanguet will not attend the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics after testing positive for COVID-19, the French organizing committee said on Monday. Estanguet was due to fly to the Chinese capital to observe the first part of the Games but will now stay in France, with Etienne Thobois, the Paris 2024 chief executive, expecting to make the trip. Estanguet was at the start of last year's Tokyo Olympics after also attending part of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympics. French Sports Minister Roxana Maracineanu will also fly to Beijing during the Games to visit French athletes.
