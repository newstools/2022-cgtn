Eight people died in northeastern Algeria on Tuesday, including three children, in a fire caused by a household gas explosion that soon spread to three adjacent buildings, the country's fire service said. The fire was partly fueled by a cache of cosmetics manufacturing materials located in a house in the town of Ain Oulmane.
