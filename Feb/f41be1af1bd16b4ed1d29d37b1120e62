U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday extended Trump-era tariffs on imported solar energy equipment by four years. However, in a major concession to the renewable energy industry, the tariffs excluded a panel technology that dominates the market for big projects, said media reports. The four-year extension includes an exemption for bifacial panels and also raised the import quota on solar cells to 5 gigawatts, up from 2.5 gigawatts, said a senior administration official.
