A used rocket booster about to crash onto the far side of the moon on March 4 is not from China's Chang'e-5 mission, according to Wang Wenbin, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA). NASA claimed last week that the rocket part was likely from China's Chang'e-5 Test Mission launched in 2014, instead of from a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket launch in 2015 as previously reported. "According to China's monitoring, the upper stage of the Chang'e-5 mission rocket has fallen through the Earth's atmosphere in a safe manner and burnt up completely," Wang said on Monday at a regular press briefing. "China's aerospace endeavors are always in keeping with international law," he said. "We are committed to earnestly safeguarding the long-term sustainability of outer space activities and are ready to have extensive exchanges and cooperation with all sides," he added.
