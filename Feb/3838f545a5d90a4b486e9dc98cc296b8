The Chinese embassy in the UK said that China firmly supports Argentina's sovereignty claim over the Islas Malvinas, in response to the UK's call to "respect Falklands' sovereignty." "China has always maintained that territorial disputes between countries should be resolved through peaceful negotiations in line with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter," the Chinese embassy spokesperson said in an online statement published on early Tuesday. "We hope Britain will actively respond to Argentina's request, start dialogue and negotiations as soon as possible with a view to finding a peaceful, just and lasting solution in accordance with relevant UN resolutions," the spokesperson said. Argentina said that the Islas Malvinas were "illegally occupied" on January 3, 1833, by British forces that "evicted the Argentine authorities legitimately established there." The UK protest on Monday came one day after the release of a joint statement between China and Argentina in which China reaffirmed support for Argentina's demand to fully exercise sovereignty over the Islas Malvinas, and for the resumption of negotiations to resolve the disputes through peaceful means in accordance with relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
