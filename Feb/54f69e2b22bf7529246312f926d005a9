Snowball fighting is an interesting winter game enjoyed by both adults and children. Generally there is no winning or losing, only the joy of playing. But in Japan, the sport is very seriously taken. An event called Yukigaseen has been invented, turning a childhood game into an intense winter sport. Yuzuki Sugimoto, Naoki Futakawame and Koki Ito are students at Muroran Institute of Technology in Japan and keen Yukigassen players. A shared passion made them close friends, and now, let's join them for a serious snowball fight!
