Thirty-year-old Samuel Ikpefan will be the first cross-country skier in the history of Nigeria to compete in the Beijing Winter Olympics. After his first skiing experience at the age of six, he dreamed of becoming a professional skier. However, without funding, and without any natural snow in his country, he had to launch a crowd-funding campaign online to purchase equipment and arrange for his travel to other countries for training and competitions. Now, because of his participation, Nigeria, a country without snow, will have the opportunity to win a medal at Beijing 2022. "Nothing is impossible," said Ikpefan.
