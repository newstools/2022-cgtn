A lot of the deals reached during the 2021-22 winter transfer window of European football were very surprising. For example, few expected financially-struggling Juventus to land Dusan Vlahovic from Fiorentina with 81.6 million euros (about $125.7 million). Meanwhile, some of the teams were making transfers to fix their previous mistakes instead of trying to make the franchise better. For example, Tottenham Hotspur sent Tanguy Ndombélé, whom they paid 60 million euros (about $92.4 million) to acquire in 2019 from Olympique Lyonnais, back to the French club on loan.
