Sean McVay, head coach of the Los Angeles Rams, confirmed to ESPN's Adam Schefter on Friday that he will remain committed to helping the team win the Super Bowl title next year instead of looking for a broadcasting job. McVay's remarks sounded like a response to the New York Post's report on the same day of the Rams coach meeting with Amazon next week. Amazon is launching a show named "Thursday Night Football" exclusively on Prime Video this autumn and is reportedly offering McVay $100 million for five years. The Rams, which have invested heavily to enhance their franchise in the past two years, won the title in Super Bowl LVI after beating the reigning champions the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the dark horse Cincinnati Bengals. However, what McVay said before the Super Bowl game at SoFi Stadium led some to believe he would be leaving the team. "I love this so much that it's such a passion but I also know that what I've seen from some of my closest friends, whether it's coaches or even some of our players, I'm gonna be married this summer, I want to have a family and I think being able to find that balance but also be able to give the time necessary," McVay said. "I have always had a dream about being able to be a father and I can't predict the future, you know? I jokingly say that." When asked if he will return in the 2022 season after the 23-20 win over the Bengals in Super Bowl LVI, McVay gave a very vague, saying "We'll see," sparking further speculation over his future with the team. Fans of the Rams felt a little relieved when they heard McVay yell "Run it back!" at the Super Bowl parade. The team has about $14 million of salary space during the off-season but multiple key players of theirs will become free agents. Having a champion coach who's confirmed to stay should help a lot in convincing players to stay or recruiting players from the market.
