Ukraine has condemned Russian naval drills near its southern coast. Kyiv said the presence of warships were part of a "hybrid war" and had made navigation in the Black Sea and Azov Sea virtually impossible. Ukraine says it would work with other partner nations to prepare a response. Moscow is staging naval drills in the Black Sea this month, as it holds ground drills north of Ukraine in Belarus, further raising tensions over the border issue.
