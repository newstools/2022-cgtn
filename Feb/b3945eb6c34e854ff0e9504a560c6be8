A spokesperson for China's top legislative body voiced firm opposition on Tuesday to the adoption by Japan's House of Representatives of a so-called resolution on human rights in China. "The so-called resolution grossly interferes in China's internal affairs and gravely violates basic norms governing international relations," said You Wenze, spokesperson for the Foreign Affairs Committee of the National People's Congress. "We firmly oppose Japan's political manipulation under the pretext of 'human rights'," You said, noting that any attempt to interfere in China's internal affairs and undermine China's interests will be met with resolute responses.
