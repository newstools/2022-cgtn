The White House has tapped three outside veterans of politics and communications to help guide U.S. President Joe Biden's eventual Supreme Court pick through the confirmation process. The team will be led by former Alabama Senator Doug Jones, whose selection as the "sherpa" was made public this week. Biden has  promised to nominate a Black woman by the end of February to replace retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer.
