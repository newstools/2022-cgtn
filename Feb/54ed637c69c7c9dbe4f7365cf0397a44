Paris police said they have arrested 97 people who defied a ban on a Canada-style protest convoy over coronavirus regulations to try to block traffic in the capital, with 81 still in custody on Sunday. In Paris, more than 100 vehicles managed to converge on the Champs-Elysees avenue, where police used tear gas to disperse protesters in scenes reminiscent of the yellow-vest riots of 2018-2019.
