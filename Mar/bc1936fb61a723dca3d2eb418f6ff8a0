China stands firmly against U.S. arms sales to Taiwan region and any forms of official exchanges or military contact between U.S. and the island. Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remark at a press conference on Wednesday while responding to a question on a recent purchasing contract of a field information and communication system between the United States and Taiwan region, which was a follow-up to the U.S. arms sale plan to the Taiwan region in December 2020. Zhu said the Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authority has repeatedly purchased arms from the U.S. with taxpayers' money and attempts to "seek independent by force." "Such attempts will not succeed and will only harm peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait and the interests of Taiwan residents," she said.
