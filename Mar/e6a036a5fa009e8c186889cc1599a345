China will expand cooperation and work with the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) countries for a China-LAC community with a shared future, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. Speaking at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing, Wang said the shared aspiration for independence, development and vitalization connects China and the LAC countries. What people in the LAC region need is "fairness, justice and mutually beneficial cooperation, not power politics, hegemony, or bullying," Wang said, adding that the region is not the backyard of anyone.
