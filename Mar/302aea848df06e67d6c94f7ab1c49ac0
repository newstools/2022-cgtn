Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday said U.S. suggestions that Moscow was blocking efforts to revive the Iran nuclear deal were untrue, following talks with his Iranian counterpart Hossein Amir Abdollahian in Moscow. Lavrov said Russia had received written assurances from Washington that sanctions against Moscow over Ukraine would not hinder cooperation within the framework of the nuclear deal. "We received written guarantees. They are included in the text of the agreement itself on the resumption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the Iranian nuclear program," Lavrov told reporters during a press conference with Abdollahian. Lavrov said Moscow and Tehran share the position that Western sanctions are imposed with the aim of overriding international law and accused Washington and its partners of directing the penalties "primarily against ordinary citizens." More than 10 months of talks in Vienna have brought major powers close to renewing the landmark 2015 deal on regulating Iran's nuclear program. The negotiations halted after Moscow earlier this month demanded guarantees that Western sanctions imposed following its "special military operation" in Ukraine would not damage its trade with Iran. During the news conference, Abdollahian said nothing can negatively impact talks in Vienna. "The interruption of talks can pave the way for the resolution of issues and the return of all parties to their nuclear deal commitments," he said.
