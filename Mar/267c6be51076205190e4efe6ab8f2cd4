Timor-Leste's election commission on Tuesday announced the results of the first round of voting in the country's fifth presidential election. Since the first-placed candidate did not receive more than 50 percent of the total number of valid votes, the top two candidates with the most votes, former president Jose Manuel Ramos-Horta and incumbent President Francisco Guterres, will continue to register and proceed to the next round of voting. The second round of voting will take place on April 19.
