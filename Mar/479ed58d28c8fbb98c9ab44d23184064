Sixty-four instances of attacks on health care in Ukraine had been verified since the Russia-Ukraine conflict began on February 24, the World Health Organization said on Thursday。 "These attacks have caused 15 deaths and 37 injuries," WHO Ukraine tweeted. According to the global health agency, the one month old conflict has caused nearly 7 million Ukrainians to be internally displaced, and among them one in three are suffering from a chronic health condition. "Attacks on health care and health workers directly impact people's ability to access essential health services – especially women, children and other vulnerable groups," according to a separate statement from WHO. The intensive fighting has also impacted COVID-19 vaccinations in Ukraine. From February 24 to March 15, COVID-19 vaccines were administered to 175,000 people, while at least 50,000 vaccinations were administered per day before the conflict began, said the WHO.
