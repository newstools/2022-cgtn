Sri Lanka on Wednesday began imposing a daily nationwide 10-hour power cut as it ran out of hydro-electricity on top of a severe shortage of fuel. Power cuts of up to 10 hours in Sri Lanka starts from March 30, said Janaka Ratnayake, Public Utilities Commission chairman, explaining that a flexible exchange regime has created severe foreign exchange shortages and power deficits in the dry season.
