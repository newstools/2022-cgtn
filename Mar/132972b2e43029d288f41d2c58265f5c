Team China are about to meet the reigning gold medalists Team USA in the para ice hockey semifinals at the 2022 Winter Paralympics. Chinese player Wang Zhidong said they have no fear of any team. Having scored the game-winning goal for China against the Czech Republic on Wednesday night, Wang looks forward to challenging USA, one of the mightiest opponents of the tournament. "Any team we will face from now will be strong opponents," Wang said. "All we need to do is to play all of the coming games in a down-to-earth manner. We will give our best with authority from the moment we are on the rink whoever we are playing again. We fear nobody." Wang revealed that in the last minutes of the game against the Czech Republic, everyone was only thinking about doing the best for the team. "When it's a draw, coach told us to forget about the score and do your best," Wang said. "As long as the game isn't over, there is always a chance." Goalie Ji Yanzhao, who performed excellently in the game against the Czech Republic, said he never doubted if his team would win. "It's such faith that got us till the end for victory," he said. After Wednesday's win, Cui Yutao, captain of Team China, got the puck from the referees for collection. "I will keep this with me for my life because it's a puck from the Winter Paralympics, not some random game." China will play against USA at the National Indoor Stadium in Beijing on Friday. The other semifinal game will take place between Canada and South Korea on the same day. The gold medal contest will happen on Sunday.
