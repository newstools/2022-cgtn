The Hang Seng Index shed 5.7 percent to 18,415.08 at market close. The Shanghai Composite Index dived 4.95 percent, or 159.57 points, to 3,063.97, while the Shenzhen Composite Index on China's second exchange lost 4.36 percent to 11,537.24.

The tech index fell again Tuesday, shedding more than five percent, with market heavyweights Alibaba, JD.com and Tencent giving up between seven and 10 percent. Shares saw a minor bounce in late morning business thanks to data out of China suggesting the economy started 2022 on a positive note. But the selling resumed in the afternoon as traders offloaded risk assets.
