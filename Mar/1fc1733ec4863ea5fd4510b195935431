The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) said it had conducted "another important" test for its reconnaissance satellite system, following an initial test on February 27, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Sunday. "Through the test, the NADA (the DPRK's National Aerospace Development Administration) confirmed the reliability of data transmission and reception system of the satellite, its control command system and various ground-based control systems," KCNA said. As for the last test on February 27, KCNA did not elaborate on the type of rocket used in the launch, but authorities in the Republic of Korea (ROK) said it appeared to be a ballistic missile fired from an area near Pyongyang where its international airport is located. The ROK's military said the DPRK missile reached a height of about 560 km and flew 270 km. (With input from Reuters)
