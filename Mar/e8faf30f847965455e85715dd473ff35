China has recently approved more than 10 kinds of COVID-19 antigen self-test kits. The National Health Commission suggested that three groups of people should use them: 1. People who develop symptoms within five days. 2. People in quarantine, such as close contacts of COVID-19 patients, overseas arrivals, and residents of areas under lockdown. 3. People who wish to take a test. The rollout of the self-test kits allows citizens to do COVID-19 tests easily at home. But self-testing cannot fully replace the more accurate nucleic acid tests as there is a risk of misdiagnosis. CGTN's Guo Meiping undertakes her first COVID-19 self-test with one of the newly approved kits. Let's see how it goes. Graphics: Yu Peng Cover Image: Yin Yating
