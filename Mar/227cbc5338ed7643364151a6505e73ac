Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China will continue to play a constructive role in promoting peace talks between Russia and Ukraine. "China is prepared to continue playing a constructive role to facilitate dialogue for peace and work alongside the international community when needed to carry out necessary mediation," Wang said, adding that the more tense the situation, the more important that the talks continue. He made the remark at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress. Wang said a large-scale humanitarian crisis should be prevented and the Red Cross Society of China would provide urgent humanitarian aid to Ukraine. The situation in Ukraine has become what it is today as a result of a variety of complex reasons, he said. "What is needed to solve complex issues is a cool head and a rational mind, not adding fuel to the fire which only intensifies the situation." When asked about whether a new cold war was on the horizon, Wang said the world is indeed becoming more divisive as certain countries have manufactured rivalries and resorted to a cold-war mentality in order to maintain their hegemony. In the face of global turbulence, China will always represent stability and positivity and stay on the right side of history, he said.
