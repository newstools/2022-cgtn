A 7.4-magnitude earthquake in northeastern Japan has left thousands of homes in Fukushima Prefecture without water. According to a Soma resident, the quake lasted for about one minute, which is longer than most. He said there were about 10 aftershocks, followed by power and water outages. As earthquakes often happen in the region, "you are mentally prepared," the resident said, "but you are still afraid."
