Russian President Vladimir Putin cannot be seen as a "valid interlocutor," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday, when asked about the possibility of an end to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. "Ukrainians themselves have got to will and to desire – it's for them to decide the future of their country," Johnson said in response to a question from a reporter following a speech in Warsaw.
