Russia's central bank has decided to gradually resume trading on the Moscow Exchange in the equity market from Monday, after the country's longest trading halt began on February 24. Federal loan bonds trading will be resumed on Monday, the Bank of Russia said in a statement on Friday. Bidding will be held from 10:00 to 11:00 Moscow time in the discrete auction mode, then from 13:00 to 17:00 Moscow time in the usual mode. Short selling on such instruments will be prohibited, the statement said. To ensure balanced liquidity in the securities market and prevent excessive volatility, the Bank of Russia will purchase federal loan bonds in the amounts necessary to limit risks to financial stability, the central bank said in a separate statement, noting "purchases will be made during the time it takes to complete the adjustment of the prices of financial instruments to the new conditions." The operating hours of the Moscow Exchange for the following days and information about the resumption of trading in other instruments in the stock market section of the Moscow Exchange will be announced later, the central bank said.
