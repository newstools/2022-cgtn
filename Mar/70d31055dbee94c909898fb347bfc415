All stocks on the Moscow Stock Exchange resumed trading on Monday after being suspended since February 25. The Moscow Stock Exchange partially reopened last Thursday, with only 33 companies on the ruble-denominated MOEX Russia Index trading. They ended the week basically flat. Investors are banned from short selling the equities, and a halt on foreigners selling the stocks remains in place. The Russian ruble also continued its recovery against the U.S. dollar, from 107 rubles to the dollar last week to 94 rubles per dollar now.
