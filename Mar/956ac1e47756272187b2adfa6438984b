A "seven-level pagoda" stone carving has been discovered by a farmer in central China's Henan Province, while renovating his yard. According to the local cultural preservation authorities, the carving was made 1,200 years ago in the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The hollow stone niche has a height of 68 cm, a width of 42 cm and a thickness of 23 cm. The right corner is engraved with a 67-word inscription, which can still be relatively easily recognized. The carving is a part of a "seven-level pagoda." The figures are still very exquisite, with Sakyamuni Dharma at the front upper part. Two stone lions are on each side of the lower part. The stone carving is of great cultural value and is an example for the study of the "Thousand Buddha Temple," according to authorities.
