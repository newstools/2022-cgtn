China will adopt a package of steps to stabilize foreign trade and make greater use of foreign investment, he said, adding that efforts will be made to ensure observance of the negative list for foreign investment and national treatment for all foreign-invested enterprises in the country. "The vast, open Chinese market is sure to provide even greater business opportunities for foreign enterprises in China," the premier said. China will also promote high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative, and deepen multilateral and bilateral economic and trade cooperations, he said. Noting that the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) has created the largest free trade zone in the world, Li said China will continue to pursue high-standard free trade agreements with more countries.
