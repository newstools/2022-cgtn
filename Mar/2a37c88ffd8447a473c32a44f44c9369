China successfully sent three satellites – Tianping 2A, 2B and 2C – into the planned orbit atop a Long March-11 carrier rocket from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China at 10:29 a.m. on Wednesday. The satellites will provide atmospheric measurements from space and facilitate the optimization of a model that forecasts satellite orbits. This was the 413th launch of the Long March rocket series. The predecessors of the three satellites, the Tianping-1 microsatellite pair, were launched in November 2018 for the precision calibration of ground monitoring equipment.
