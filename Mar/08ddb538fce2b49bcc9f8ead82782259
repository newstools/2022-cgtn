China on Wednesday voiced strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition after Britain pulled two British judges from the highest court of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. "By playing the 'foreign judges' card, Britain attempted to maliciously slander the Chinese government's policies for Hong Kong, and to discredit the development of the rule of law in Hong Kong," a spokesperson for the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said in a statement.
