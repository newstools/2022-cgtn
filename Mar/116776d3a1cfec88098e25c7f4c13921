Benfica, Chelsea, Villarreal and Atletico Madrid reached the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals after two days of competitions on Tuesday and Thursday. Benfica beat Ajax 1-0 on the road after 22-year-old Darwin Nunez scored his 26th goal of the season. Chelsea had a solid 2-1 win over Lille OSC, continuing their title-defending journey with a very unpredictable future of the franchise. Atletico Madrid defeated Manchester United 1-0 while taking away the magic of Cristiano Ronaldo who had no shot at all facing the defense designed by Diego Simeone. Villarreal beat Juventus 3-0 and scored all of their three goals in the last 15 minutes, eliminating the last Italian club out of the Champions League. The draw for the quarterfinals will take place on Friday. Host: Li Xiang Guest: Josh McNally Cover designer: Feng Yuan Chief editor: Chen Ran Supervisor: Zhang Shilei
