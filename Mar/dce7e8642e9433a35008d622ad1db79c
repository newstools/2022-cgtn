At noon, in the wilderness of the mountain, cinereous vultures are searching for food. Bare mountains and open plains are the best places for them to find their prey. Decaying carcasses of large animals are their favorite. About 'Journeys in Nature': Sanjiangyuan series In the Sanjiangyuan Series, we present the stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife of the Sanjiangyuan Region, where the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers all originate. Sanjiangyuan has earned the title "Water tower of China," because the abundant glacier resources here have a freshwater reserve of 200 billion cubic meters. The precious water has nurtured numerous wild flora and fauna like snow leopards, Himalayan blue sheep, Thorold's deer, Tibetan wild asses, and vultures.
