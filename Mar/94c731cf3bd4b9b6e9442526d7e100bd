It was a wonderful and memorable sight. Ninety dancers waltzing across a bright and colorful stage beneath their feet. This was the Winter Paralympic Waltz, the brainchild of Zhang Haidi, chairperson of the China Disabled Persons' Federation. Of those 90 dancers, 50 were hearing impaired. The documentary follows them during the 90 days before the ceremony as they prepare for their moment in the spotlight. It reveals the challenges they faced, and how they were supported and encouraged by their fellow dancers, their sign language interpreters and their choreographers. "The Wonder of Dance" is the story of how understanding can create harmony and great endeavor can create an unforgettable spectacle.
