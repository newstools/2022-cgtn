Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday delivered written remarks to the third Foreign Ministers' Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, held in Tunxi in east China's Anhui Province. Xi said Afghanistan is in urgent need of development in many areas after having gone through so much in the past. "Afghanistan is a common neighbor and partner of all participating countries," he said. "We form a community with a shared future linked by the same mountains and rivers who would rise and fall together." A peaceful, stable, developing and prosperous Afghanistan is the aspiration of all the Afghan people and is the common interests of regional countries and the international community, he said. China always respects Afghanistan's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and has committed to supporting its pursuit of peace, stability and development, he said. Since its launch last September, the coordination and cooperation mechanism among neighbors of Afghanistan has endeavored to bring into play the strengths of neighboring countries and played a constructive role in promoting the steady transition in Afghanistan, he added. Xi called on the neighboring countries of Afghanistan to do their best to build consensus and coordinate efforts to support the people of Afghanistan in building a brighter future. (Cover: The third Foreign Ministers' Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan is held in Tunxi in east China's Anhui Province, March 31, 2021. /CGTN)
