A launch ceremony for the BRICS Vaccine Research and Development (R&D) Center was held online on Tuesday. In a speech, Chinese Minister of Science and Technology Wang Zhigang said that China will work with other BRICS countries Brazil, Russia, India, and South Africa to use the center to promote exchanges and cooperation on R&D and testing. China will work with member nations to establish vaccine plants and the mutual recognition of standards to strengthen the defense against COVID-19 and deliver hope and confidence for global economic recovery, Wang said. The five countries proposed an initiative to strengthen vaccine cooperation to ensure the accessibility and affordability of vaccines in developing countries through their equitable distribution as global public goods. The initiative is also aimed at enhancing BRICS countries' capability to control infectious diseases and respond to public health events. It emphasizes openness and welcomes more partners to join. The launch of the BRICS Vaccine R&D Center and the initiative mark a leap forward in strengthening cooperation on public health and vaccine R&D among BRICS countries. Officials and representatives from the five nations attended the ceremony online.
