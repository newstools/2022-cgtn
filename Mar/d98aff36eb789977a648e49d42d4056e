A clap of thunder in spring starts the growth of every living thing. Jingzhe, or the Awakening of Insects, which is the third of China's 24 solar terms, falls on March 5 this year. Solar terms, as part of ancient China's agricultural civilization, reflect Chinese people's wisdom on the seasonal changes for farming. Ancient Chinese divided every solar term into three five-day pentads. Usually these pentads reflect the climatological and phenological changes during the solar term, and some of them indicate changes in animals' activities. In Jingzhe's first pentad, peach blossoms turn red, like rosy clouds and brocade. After the first five days, orioles begin to sing. In the last five days, there are only the turtle doves singing. During the period of Jingzhe, both spring thunder and rain increase, which brings vitality back to the earth. With a sense of spring in the air, there's thriving scenery everywhere.
