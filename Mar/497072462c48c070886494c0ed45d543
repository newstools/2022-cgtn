Super Bowl LVI champions Los Angeles Rams have reached agreement with their starting quarterback Matthew Stafford over a four-year, $160 million contract extension, including $135 million guaranteed, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Stafford currently has one season left of his five-year, $135 million deal signed with the Detroit Lions and he is 34 years old. When his new contract comes to an end in 2026, it's likely the end of his career. Though it's a juicy deal, the Rams' offer was hardly the best Stafford could get after leading the team to win the Super Bowl title. Aaron Rodgers, who was the MVP but eliminated in the National Football Conference (NFC) Divisional game, reportedly stayed in the Green Bay Packers with a three-year, $150 million contract. However, if Stafford aims for more rings instead of just more money, he should stay in the Rams. Having played 12 seasons for the Lions, he didn't win even one playoff game there. By contrast, he won the Super Bowl title in his first season with the Rams. Accepting a relatively smaller contract will enable the team to keep more of their core members with whom Stafford has been familiar. Last season, Stafford completed 404 of his 601 passes in 17 games for 4,886 yards and 41 touchdowns (TDs) in the regular season. Then in the playoffs, he passed for 1,188 yards and four TDs, leading the Rams to achieve four victories over the Arizona Cardinals, Tampa Bay Buccaneers, San Francisco 49ers and Cincinnati Bengals to win his first Super Bowl title. The Rams saw their eight-time Pro Bowl linebacker Von Miller depart for the Buffalo Bills and that's why they need to do every possible to convince three-time Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald to continue to stay and play longer for the team. Offensively, the Rams signed veteran wide receiver Allen Robinson and are currently negotiating new contract with Odell Beckham Jr.
