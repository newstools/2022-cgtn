China will further carry out policies in favor of foreign trade and safeguard the smooth operation of supply chains despite difficulties and pressures, China's Commerce Minister Wang Wentao said on Tuesday.China's total goods imports and exports rose 21.4 percent year on year to 39.1 trillion yuan (about $6.2 trillion) in 2021. Exports of goods and services accounted for over 20 percent of the economic growth. But some market analysts call for caution over the uptick, as China might face many pressures and difficulties this year in foreign trade and commerce if it wants to maintain the growth momentum. "Our analysis also reflects that there will be huge pressure, and the situation is severe. We face three major challenges. Global demand is shrinking, and many organizations have lowered their expectations for economic growth. The supply chain isn't back to normal yet. Trade companies still face all sorts of problems and are hesitant in taking new orders," Wang said. But he said China is confident in overcoming the difficulties and is taking necessary measures. "We will implement policies to stabilize trade and commerce. We will especially help small and medium-sized businesses to expand their markets and make their orders. We will also ensure the stability and unblocking of the supply and industrial chains by strengthening international cooperation. We will promote the innovative development of foreign trade, including the promotion of cross-border e-commerce, overseas warehouse networks, and green trade," Wang said.On China's overall trade policy for 2022, Wang says the key is making progress while maintaining stability. The plan is to expand domestic demand, boost consumption recovery, further open up markets and stabilize trade and investment.
