The death toll rose to 75 following a freight train derailment in the southeastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), local authorities said Sunday. The derailment of the 15-wagon train occurred late Thursday in the district of Lubudi of DRC's southeastern Lualaba Province. At least 125 people were injured. DRC's Ministry of Communication and Media said the train lost control before seven of the 15 wagons ended up in a ravine due to a locomotive traction failure. Train derailments are common in the DRC, as are shipwrecks of overloaded boats on the country's lakes and rivers. (With input from agencies)
