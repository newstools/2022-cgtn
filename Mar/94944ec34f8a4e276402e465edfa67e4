China slammed U.S. former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's recent remarks as nonsense, in which he claimed that "U.S. should recognize Taiwan," Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang wenbin said on Friday. Mike Pompeo said that "U.S should recognize Taiwan as a free and sovereign country" during his visit in China's Taiwan region. "Mike Pompeo is a former politician with bankrupt credibility, and his nonsense is doomed to failure," Wang said at a regular news conference on Friday.
