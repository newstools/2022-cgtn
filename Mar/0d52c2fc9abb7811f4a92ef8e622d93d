China supports all efforts that are conducive to de-escalation and political settlement of the situation, and opposes any move that does no good to the pursuit of diplomatic settlement and adds fuel to the fire, said a spokesperson of the Chinese Mission to the EU on Saturday. The spokesperson's remarks came after EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said that China should mediate between Russia and Ukraine. "We encourage Russia and Ukraine to have direct negotiations. We also encourage the U.S., NATO and the EU to engage in equal-footed dialogue with Russia," said the spokesperson, stressing following the principle of indivisible security and seeking to build a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism. The evolution of the Ukraine issue is something China does not want to see, the spokesperson said, adding the Ukraine issue is complicated and China always decides its position and policy according to the merits of the matter itself. China believes that to resolve the Ukraine crisis, it's necessary to act in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, respect and uphold the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries, and pursue peaceful settlement of disputes through dialogue, the spokesperson noted.
