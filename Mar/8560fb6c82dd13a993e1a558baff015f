Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Monday urged Japan to honor a series of promises it has made and avoid damaging ties with its neighbors. Relations between China and Japan still face challenges, Wang said, noting that some people in Japan don't want to see a fast-growing China or stable bilateral ties. He called on Japan to put its ties with China on the right track and commit itself to observing the consensus the two countries reached before. "We hope that Japan will go along the trend instead of against it, decline to pull chestnuts out of the fire for others, and avoid pitting itself against its neighbors," Wang said at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress.
