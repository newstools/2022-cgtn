After weeks of speculation, Los Angeles Rams' veteran lineman Andrew Whitworth announced his retirement from the NFL, ending an illustrious 16-year career at one of the most demanding positions of the sport. Last month, the 40-year-old turned back the clock to guide the Rams to win a Vince Lombardi Trophy against the Cincinnati Bengals in the the Super Bowl. Then he was awarded the NFL Walter Payton Man of the Year for the first time after numerous nominations. "I'm here to close the chapter on my NFL playing career," said Whitworth in a social media post on Tuesday night. "I have played this game most of my life. At one time, my story felt it would end with frustrations of Pro Bowl snubs, wins without championships, and have a career record of being 0-7 in the playoffs. I even lost my first chance at winning a Super Bowl. But that's not how the story ended. I still held the pen." "As long as we are blessed in life to have opportunity, we have the chance to write our own story. Thank you to all my teammates for chasing greatness with me, our fellowship in the locker room, and our brotherhood off the field," he added. "Thank you to the coaches and support staff who have always been there for me. And to my family and friends, I could have never done it without you. I love you." "The next chapter is exciting and I can't wait to fall in love with football in a whole new way.  Finally, to the game of football, thank you for the moments both high and low because all of those moments helped me become who I am." Rams' Joe Noteboom, who signed a contract extension with the club earlier this week, will replace Whitworth on the offensive line next season.
