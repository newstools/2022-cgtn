China's water conservancy and hydropower projects on the Lancang River have been adhering to the principle of adjusting peaks to alleviate pressure on down-river countries at times of floods and droughts, Li Guoying, minister of water resources, said. Li made the remarks last Friday in an exclusive interview with CGTN in Beijing, in response to recent media reports questioning China's water conservancy projects on the upper reaches of the Lancang. The river is also known as Mekong in the lower reaches through Southeast Asia.
