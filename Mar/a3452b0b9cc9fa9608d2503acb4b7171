Washington is imposing Russia-related sanctions on 13 individuals and 21 entities, the U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday. Earlier on Thursday, the UK also announced sanctions on 14 more Russian entities and people, including on state media organizations behind RT and Sputnik and some of their senior figures. The West stepped up sanctions against Russia since it launched the "special military operation" on February 24. Touching on the matter on Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said Western nations will try to find new grounds to sanction Russia and his country must aim to retain jobs and create new ones. In his televised remarks, Putin also said that the U.S. was profiting from the global turbulence and its military complex companies were on the rise. (With input from Reuters)
