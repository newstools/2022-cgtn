Football superstar Lionel Messi scored on his return to the national team as Argentina stretched their world-leading unbeaten run to 30 matches with a routine 3-0 World Cup qualifying win over Venezuela on Friday. Goals from Nicolas Gonzalez and Angel Di Maria, both created by Rodrigo De Paul, kept a packed La Bombonera stadium enthralled in Buenos Aires. Messi himself got the third three minutes later when he chested down a Di Maria pass before past Venezuela's keeper Wuilker Farinez. Argentina have long qualified for the World Cup in Qatar later this year, while Venezuela were the first team in South America's single ten-nation qualification group to be eliminated. Argentina, two-time world champions and current Copa America winners will be joined in Qatar by fellow South American teams Brazil, Ecuador and Uruguay, while Peru, Colombia and Chile are battling for fifth place and a playoff spot against a team from the Asian confederation. The final round of games will take place on March 29.
