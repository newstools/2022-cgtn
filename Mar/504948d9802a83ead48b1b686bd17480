As the conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates, tens of thousands of Ukrainians are thronging at the Polish border seeking refuge. Polish Deputy Interior Minister Maciej Wasik said that more than 350,000 Ukrainian refugees have arrived in Poland since last Thursday. The United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) said on Monday that more than half a million people have already fled to Poland, Romania, Hungary and other neighboring countries. Many Ukrainian parents are racing against time to get their children out of danger.
