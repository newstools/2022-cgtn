Iran has "temporarily" suspended normalization talks with Saudi Arabia, Iran's Press TV reported on Sunday. The Iranian side has "unilaterally and temporarily" suspended the talks which were slated to be held in Iraq next week, according to the report. The report did not specify the reason for the pause or a date for resuming the negotiations. Following several rounds of talks brokered by Iraq, Iran sent three diplomats to Saudi Arabia in January as a delegation to the Organization of Islamic Cooperation to resume their activities in Jeddah after a six-year hiatus. Saudi Arabia cut diplomatic ties with Iran in early 2016 in protest against the attacks on a Saudi diplomatic mission in Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shiite cleric. On Saturday, Saudi Arabia said it had executed 81 men in its biggest mass execution in decades, a move Iran saw as "inhumane." "This inhumane act was in violation of basic principles of human rights and international law, and contrary to human principles and accepted legal procedures," an Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said, according to state media. Saudi Arabia has denied the accusation of human rights abuses and said  it protects its national security through its laws. Its state news agency, SPA, said the men executed on Saturday had the right to an attorney and were guaranteed their full rights under Saudi law during the judicial process. (With input from agencies)
