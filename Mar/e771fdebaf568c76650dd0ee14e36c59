The San Antonio Spurs beat the Utah Jazz 104-102 at AT&T Center on Friday to secure the 1,336th win of their head coach Gregg Popovich. 73-year-old Popovich had shared the spot with Don Nelson, with 1,335 wins each but has now secured the title of the most all-time regular season coaching wins in NBA history for himself. "All of us share in this record. It's not mine. It's ours, here in the city," he said. The Spurs overcame a 15-point deficit for the home win over the Jazz. Dejounte Murray, the team's only All-Star player this season, scored 15 points for the team in the last quarter, making major contributions to their 40-28 rally in this quarter. Having achieved their 26th win of the season, the Spurs continued to rank 11th in the Western Conference and trail by one game behind the New Orleans Pelicans and the play-in tournament zone. The Spurs' final rankings and records for the previous two seasons were 32-39 (2019-20) and 33-29 (2020-21), disqualified for the postseason, but not good enough to receive a top five draft pick. The 2021-22 season is very likely to end in the same way. In fact, the Spurs only reached the playoffs once since their legendary combination of Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginobili left, and the team has lost in the first round. The last time the Spurs tanked was in the first season of Popovich in 1996-97. They ruled David Robinson out after six games and finished that season 20-62. They got the first overall pick in the 1997 NBA Draft and selected Duncan, who then brought five titles together with Parker, Ginobili and Popovich. All of the Big Three have left. Only Popovich is still in his position. His team remains one of the league's least-modern franchises. The Spurs shot an average of 31.4 triples (27th in 30 teams), made 11 of them (27th in 30 teams) and walked to the free throw line 19.5 times (29th in 30 teams) and made 14.4 of them (30th in 30 teams) per game. Meanwhile, the team shot 61.7 2-point field goals (FGs) (1st in 30 teams), made 32.6 of them (1st in 30 teams) and delivered 28 assists on average (1st in 30 teams). The Spurs played with their unique style in most of the 26 seasons under Popovich. Sometimes they won titles, sometimes they were upset early in the postseason. Things didn't go their way as much as they used to after the exit of their super stars, but there is a limit for what a coach can do. "It's just a testament to a whole lot of people," Popovich said of his all-time record. "Something like this does not belong to one individual. Basketball's a team sport. You preach to your players that they have to do it together and that's certainly been the case in my life with all the wonderful players and coaches, the staff that I've been blessed with, the support of this wonderful city. The fans support us no matter what." Second 50+points game for James in a week The Los Angeles Lakers beat the Washington Wizards 122-109 at Crypto.com on Friday after LeBron James scored 50+points again in less than a week. The 37-year-old super star shot 6 for 9 in 3-pointers in the home game. When James is that hot from outside, it's almost impossible to contain him, especially when the Wizards have no specific plan to defend him. They watched James overpower Raul Neto by size and might in screen plays, even when players tried to double-team James, it didn't take him much to find an open teammate cutting to the hoop with bullet passes. During the Lakers' 70-50 rally in the second half, James had 33 points, not to mention he made all six FG shots, including four jumpers, in the last quarter. "We just needed to pick our energy up and get more detailed about how we wanted to attack the Wizards. We did that, especially in the third quarter," James said. "I was able to hit a hot streak at one point. I just tried to stay in that zone as long as possible and hit a couple." Friday's win gave the purple and gold breathing room because their lead over the following New Orleans Pelicans grew to 2.5 games. By contrast, the Wizards saw their trailing behind the Atlanta Hawks extended to 2.5 games. With only 17 games to go (for the Wizards), the capital team can't afford to lose more games like this. Kyle Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope met the Lakers for the first time at Crypto.com Arena since they had been traded for Russell Westbrook during the offseason. Many home fans welcomed them with applause. They probably wouldn't have done that if the two remained with the purple and gold, especially after their performance on Friday night. Caldwell-Pope got only four points. Though he scored team-high 23 points, Kuzma had the second-worst plus-minus of -18 of the Wizards. Westbrook didn't do much, or any better, after shooting 2 for 11 to get only five points and nine rebounds for the Lakers.
