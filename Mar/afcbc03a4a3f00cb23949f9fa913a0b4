The World Bank announced more than $1 billion in humanitarian aid for Afghanistan on Tuesday, stating that it will go to UN agencies and international NGOs and will "remain outside the control of the interim Taliban administration." The funds, to be delivered in the form of grants, aim "to support the delivery of essential basic services, protect vulnerable Afghans, help preserve human capital and key economic and social services, and reduce the need for humanitarian assistance in the future," the Washington-based institution said in a statement.
