China will stick to its global vaccine cooperation action initiative and ensure distribution equity, especially to developing countries, according to Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC). China has provided over 2.1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to over 120 mainly developing countries, and organizations, Zhang told a press conference on Friday. "China has played an important role in helping many developing countries build a defense of immunization and bring their economies and life back to normalcy," Zhang said. China will provide another one billion COVID-19 vaccine doses to African countries, including 600 million doses as donations, furthering the effort to reach the target of a 60 percent vaccination rate in 2022 set by the African Union.
