Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan on Saturday urged regions experiencing severe epidemic outbreaks to clear COVID-19 cases among the general public in the shortest time possible. Sun made the remarks at a national teleconference of the State Council joint prevention and control mechanism against COVID-19. The Chinese mainland on Friday reported 476 locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and 112 imported COVID-19 cases. Sun called for resolute measures to get outbreaks under control as soon as possible. Efforts should be made to expand the coverage of nucleic acid testing, accelerate epidemiological screening and patient transportation and isolation, and apply quarantine measures in a strict way, said the vice premier. Top priority should be given to preventing imported cases, with ports of entry as key areas and those subject to closed-loop management as the key link, she added. Sun also asked schools to strengthen daily health monitoring, ramp up the proportion of random nucleic acid testing and guard against clusters of infection.
