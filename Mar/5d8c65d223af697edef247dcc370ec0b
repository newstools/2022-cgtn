The Japanese parliament's House of Representatives chamber approved Tuesday a new special agreement that would increase the cost of hosting U.S. forces in Japan for five years. The government wants to have the House of Councillors pass and approve the agreement by the end of the month. The total amount is expected to amount to 1.551 trillion yen ($13.1 billion) over the next five years.
