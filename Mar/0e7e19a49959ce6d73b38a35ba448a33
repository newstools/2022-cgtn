The recent clusters are mainly of the Omicron variant, which is highly transmissible but has relatively mild symptoms. In Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities, where a resurgence has been reported, mass nucleic acid testing and closed-loop management have been applied in residential communities at risk of infection. In Jilin, where the cities of Changchun and Jilin have been the hardest hit, authorities recently distributed millions of COVID-19 self-test antigen kits to accelerate epidemiological screening. The province reported 1,834 confirmed locally transmitted cases and 792 local asymptomatic carriers on Thursday.
