The Paralympic Heritage Flame for the Beijing Winter Paralympics was lit on Monday in Stoke Mandeville, a village northwest of London that is recognized as the birthplace of the Paralympic Games. Ever since the 2012 London Paralympics, the lighting of the Paralympic flame in Mandeville has been a tradition for every Games. Angie Malone and Aileen Neilson, two of Britain's wheelchair curling Paralympic medalists, attended the ceremony and Malone lit the flame. The flame will be sent virtually from Stoke Mandeville to Beijing, and the torch relay will then run from March 2 to 4 in Beijing, Yanqing and Zhangjiakou. Zahir Mohammed, Chairman of the Buckinghamshire County Council, said that he holds high expectations for the upcoming Games and he's looking forward to the competitions.
