President Xi Jinping on Wednesday planted trees in Beijing, marking the 10th year of his participation as the top leader in the annual tree-planting activity in the Chinese capital. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, said he did so to make his contribution to building a beautiful China and to encourage the whole of society, especially the young people, to push for ecological advancement so that China's environment will become even better. The activity was also attended by other leaders including Li Keqiang, Li Zhanshu, Wang Yang, Wang Huning, Zhao Leji, Han Zheng and Wang Qishan. The leaders planted trees with people from Beijing at a city park in the southern district of Daxing. While planting saplings of different types of trees, Xi asked the young students around him about their studies, motivated them to foster a sense of hard work, and told them to boost their awareness of the need to protect the environment and conserve resources. "Since the 18th CPC National Congress, we have adhered to the notion that lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets to fully promote the development of ecological civilization, advance afforestation and improve the living environment in both urban and rural areas," Xi said. "A beautiful China is becoming a reality." The president also stressed continuous and arduous efforts to protect and restore the ecological system and achieve the fundamental improvement of the environment.
