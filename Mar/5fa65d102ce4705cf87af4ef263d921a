China has temporarily included antigen tests in its medical insurance offerings as an interim measure against COVID-19, according to the National Healthcare Security Administration. Antigen test expenses incurred at designated grassroots medical institutions should be settled pursuant to existing provisions of social pooling units, and the cost of antigen testing reagents at designated retail pharmacies can be covered by individual accounts, the administration said in a circular issued on Monday. Provincial authorities should incorporate antigen testing reagents and corresponding tests into the service catalog for their basic medical insurance and continue to regulate the price of such services, the circular said. They are also asked to cover the cost of the newly added medicine listed in the updated diagnosis and treatment protocol for COVID-19 via their medical insurance funds. While sticking to the dynamic zero-COVID strategy, China has approved five locally made COVID-19 antigen kits to be used for self-testing, making it easier to detect potential patients as people can do the test from the comfort of their homes.
