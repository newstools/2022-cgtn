Spain's former King Juan Carlos I will remain for now in the United Arab Emirates but will visit Spain frequently, the Royal Palace of Madrid said on Monday, a week after the country's prosecutor office dropped two investigations into alleged fraud in his business dealings. Juan Carlos, 84, who left Spain for the United Arab Emirates under a cloud of scandal in August 2020, has been the subject of multiple money-laundering investigations by Spanish and Swiss authorities for the past two years.
