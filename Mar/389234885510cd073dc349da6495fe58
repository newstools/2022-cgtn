Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Monday stressed the importance of tiding over difficulties to ensure the stable economic growth of the country. Li made the remarks while presiding over an executive meeting of the State Council, days after China's top legislature approved a report on the work of the government. The work report lists the Chinese government's major tasks for 2022, including achieving stable macroeconomic performance and keeping major economic indicators within the appropriate range. Li urged a "solid and strong" implementation of the major tasks at the meeting. Noting that the economy is faced with new downward pressure and more difficulties and challenges, the State Council said China should strengthen cyclical adjustments, put stabilizing growth in a more prominent position, and deepen reform and opening-up so as to strive to achieve the targets and tasks of the year. Efforts should be made to closely monitor how the international situation and commodity prices impact China so as to improve responses to ensure that the country's economic growth, employment and prices stabilize in a reasonable range, the State Council said. Policies on keeping the operations of market entities stable and maintaining job security by strengthening macro policies should be fully implemented, said the State Council. Efforts should also be made to implement policies on promoting stable growth of foreign trade and investment, according to the State Council.
