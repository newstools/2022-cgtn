The cruise terminal facilitated 379 cruise vessels and the ship repair docks served 16.5 percent more vessels. "The continuous increase in the company's turnover despite the difficulties we have all faced in the past due to the pandemic reveals a highly resilient company built on solid foundations," Yu Zenggang, PPA's chairman, said. Key link in China's Belt and Road Initiative China's COSCO Shipping acquired the majority of PPA's shares in 2016 after an international tender, and the Port of Piraeus near Athens has since become one of the most critical links in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Thanks to the BRI proposed in 2013 by Chinese President Xi Jinping, who visited Piraeus in November 2019, the ancient port is bustling with fresh vitality and eyeing a promising future. Over recent years, with the BRI gaining steam around the world, fresh vigor has been injected into the growth of the port, which has become a flagship project in China-Greece cooperation and a success in global BRI collaboration.
