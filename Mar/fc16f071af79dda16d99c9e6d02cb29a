Any attempts to distort China's intentions and spread rumors to smear China are "irresponsible and immoral," as they aim to provoke confrontation and take advantage of the Russia-Ukraine conflict for profit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday. On Monday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi stressed that the sanctions should not affect China when speaking to his Spanish counterpart Jose Manuel Albares. "China has the right to safeguard its legitimate rights and interests," Wang added. At Wednesday's presser, a journalist asked Zhao if Wang's remarks serve as a warning to other countries that China should not be sanctioned. Zhao responded that China's position on sanctions has remained clear. Sanctions are not the way to solve problems, Zhao said, adding that China has urged all countries to work toward de-escalation through dialogue, consultation and negotiation to prevent further escalation. He continued that China opposes any form of illegal unilateral sanctions and urges relevant parties not to undermine its legitimate rights and interests. Zhao then criticized the disinformation disseminated by the U.S. regarding China's stance on the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and comments by White House press secretary Jen Psaki, who said China will face "significant consequences" if it helps Russia evade the sanctions imposed by the U.S. and its European partners. Such bullying and coercive remarks have exposed the U.S.'s Cold War mentality, zero-sum mindset and bloc confrontation mentality, Zhao said.
