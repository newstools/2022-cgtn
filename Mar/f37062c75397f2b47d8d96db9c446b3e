The Phoenix Suns have won three of their recent four games in the absence of Chris Paul. Though the opponents they beat, like the Oklahoma City and Portland trail Blazers, are hardly playoff teams, the Suns lost to the Utah Jazz, which are fourth in the Western Conference, by only four points. Paul, who has averaged 14.9 points and 10.7 assists this season, has been nothing but integral to the Suns. But on the other hand, he is 36 years old and always suffered injuries in the post-season. If the Suns can maintain their leading position and have a healthy Paul back right before the playoffs begin, it should be a great boost to the team's form and confidence in the NBA Championship competitions beginning in April.
