A Moscow court banned Facebook and Instagram in Russia and labeled them as "extremist organizations," Russia Today (RT) reported on Monday. The ban came after the platforms' owner, US-tech giant Meta, "allowed online hate speech against the country's nationals," according to the report. Meta said in the court that it was not carrying out extremist activities and stood against Russophobia, Interfax reported. WhatsApp messenger will remain operational in the country, RT report said.
