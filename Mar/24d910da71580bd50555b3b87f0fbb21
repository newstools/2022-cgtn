The cybersecurity community, in China, found hacking activities originated from the U.S. which targeted Russia, Ukraine and Belarus since late February. The hackers remote controlled computers (physically located in China) to launch cyberattacks. This technique is known as "jump box" that is usually used to hide the identity of the true attackers and shift the blame to others. The National Computer Network Emergency Response Technical Team/Coordination Center of China, a non-profit cybersecurity organization known as the CNCERT/CC, found the hacks and traced them back to U.S. addresses. According to the analysis from CNCERT/CC, the attacks mainly originated in the U.S., while the remaining few came from Germany and the Netherlands. At the peak of the attacks, hackers sent 36 gigabits of data every second. 87 percent of the attacks targeted Russia. The CNCERT/CC said they have taken maximum countermeasures against the attacks.
