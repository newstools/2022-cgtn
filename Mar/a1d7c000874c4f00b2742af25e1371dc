China's Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft made a controlled re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere at 6:40 p.m. Beijing Time (10:40 a.m. GMT) on Thursday, according to the China Manned Space Engineering Office. The majority of the spacecraft burned up upon entry, while some small bits of debris splashed down in a safe sea area in the remote South Pacific. The Tianzhou-2 is the first cargo spacecraft sent into orbit in the key technology verification phase of the China Space Station, carrying 6.8 tonnes of supplies to the space station. During its operation in orbit, the Tianzhou-2 carried out a series of extended application tests, including four rendezvous and docking with the Tianhe core module and a test of maneuvering the cargo ship using a robotic arm. The success has paved the way for the follow-up in-orbit assembly work for the space station's construction. After the Shenzhou-13 crew's return in mid-April, China will launch the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft followed by the Shenzhou-14 crewed spaceship. During their stay, two lab modules, Wentian and Mengtian, will be sent successively into space. Formation of a T-shape complex will mark the completion of the space station. The Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft was launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in southern island province of Hainan on May 29, 2021.
