China's law against foreign sanctions is a defensive measure to cope with containment and repression and is fundamentally different from "unilateral" sanctions imposed by certain countries, Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), told a press conference on Friday. He said China does not stir up trouble but if others do it is not afraid. He stressed that China will safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests and protect lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and organizations with measures including the law against foreign sanctions. Zhang highlighted that China always stands for developing friendly relations with other countries based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and opposes hegemonism and power politics.
