Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday will travel to Antalya in southern Turkey, where he plans to meet with Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Wednesday. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu announced earlier this week that the meeting would take place on Thursday, as Ankara seeks to mediate between Moscow and Kyiv over the Ukraine crisis. Cavusoglu will also attend the meeting. "God willing, we will hold this meeting in a trilateral format in Antalya on Thursday" on the sidelines of a diplomatic forum, Cavusoglu said Monday in comments published in the official Anadolu news agency.   The announcement of the meeting came after Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan held phone talks with his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts.   "Upon President @RTErdogan's initiatives and our intensive diplomatic efforts, Foreign Ministers Sergei Lavrov of Russia and Dmytro Kuleba of Ukraine have decided to meet with my participation on the margins of @AntalyaDF," Cavusoglu tweeted.   "Hope this step will lead to peace and stability," he commented.   It will be the meeting at the highest level between Russian and Ukrainian officials since the start of Russia's "special military operation" in Ukraine on February 24. Russia and Ukraine have held three rounds of peace talks, without achieving major breakthrough. (With input from AFP)
