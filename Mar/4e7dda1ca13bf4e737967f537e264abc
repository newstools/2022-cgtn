Russia has banned airlines from 36 countries from its airspace in response to bans on its planes from European and Canadian airspace. Airlines will only be able to enter Russian airspace with a special permit, meaning flights will have to make long detours on some routes. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also signed a decree that introduces special economic measures regarding sanctions imposed by the West. Putin addressed the sanctions as he discussed the economy with top officials on Monday.
