Venezuela on Tuesday released at least two U.S. citizens who had been held by the Venezuelan government on charges of financial crimes or terrorism, according to U.S. officials and a Venezuelan human rights organization. The release came after a high-level American delegation met Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Saturday. Maduro confirmed on Monday that he had a two-hour meeting with the delegation on energy security, regional stability and other issues. "We are bringing Gustavo Cardenas and Jorge Fernandez home," U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement on Tuesday. "I am grateful to Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens and our entire diplomatic team for their tireless efforts to secure their release and reunite these families."
