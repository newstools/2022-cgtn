A new batch of 300 doctors and nurses from the mainland has arrived in Hong Kong to reinforce the city's ability to reduce coronavirus-related severe cases and deaths. Among them are 15 medical workers from Guangzhou-based Sun Yat-Sen Memorial Hospital, including physician Liu Ting. After being informed by her hospital on March 5 to support Hong Kong, Liu told her two daughters the news. Reluctant at first though, the girls came to understand their mother's intention and they wrote a letter to Hong Kong children. "Now I'm sending my beloved mommy to Hong Kong to help everyone," said one daughter in the letter. "Let's work together to fight the pandemic. Hope mom will come back soon. Go mom! Go Hong Kong!"
