Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid said on Monday that the conference of foreign ministers between Israel and four Arab countries will become a permanent annual regional forum in the future. Lapid made the announcement after hosting the first conference with the foreign ministers from the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain, Morocco and Egypt that kicked off Sunday in Sde Boker, a kibbutz in the Negev Desert in southern Israel and the final home of David Ben-Gurion, Israel's founding father and first prime minister. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also attended the two-day conference, which mainly discussed the emerging agreement on renewing the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and ways to build a regional partnership.
