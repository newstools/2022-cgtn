The most important objective now is to end the fight and let the citizens in Donetsk return to their normal lives, Denis Pushilin, the leader of the Donetsk Region, told CGTN in an exclusive interview on Friday (March 4). "This is what Donbas has been longing for, for reconstruction, for normalcy," Pushilin said, adding that "the vast majority of citizens want to be as close to Russia as possible." When asked when the conflict will end, he said that no one can give an exact date or a precise prediction, because the final date will be influenced by many external and internal factors. He stressed that the wisest thing for Ukraine to do is to lay down arms not only in the Donbas region, but in the rest of Ukraine. "It will save soldiers' lives, it will save civilians' lives. Civilians have been killed in armed operations by the Ukrainians," he said. He also said that the relief headquarters of Donetsk are conducting work regarding rehabilitation and reconstruction. "From the simplest humanitarian relief packages, food and medicine to the more important ones, restoration of electricity, communications, the opening of medical facilities and so on," said Pushilin.
