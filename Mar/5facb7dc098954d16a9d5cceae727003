Ukrainian nuclear power plant operator Energoatom said all nuclear power plants in the country, including the Zaporizhzhia site seized by Russian military forces, are running stably. Ukrainian authorities earlier accused Russian forces of setting fire to a training facility adjacent to Zaporizhzhia. Russia's defense ministry blamed the attack on Ukrainian saboteurs, calling it a "monstrous provocation." Ukraine has four running nuclear power stations, providing electricity for some 50 percent of the country's power needs.
