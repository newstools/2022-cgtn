As spring gradually unfolds, it also becomes the high time for most of the birds to display their courtship rituals. A couple of black-collared starlings in the mist of blooming neem tree flowers in Haikou City, south China's Hainan Province, is just one of those who waste no time to show their affections toward each other. The black-collared starling can be found in southern China and in Southeast Asia. They usually live in grasslands, dry forests and human habitats.
