U.S. President Joe Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Tuesday, assuring "continued backing" and "sustained help" to the east European country. "President Biden underscored the United States' sustained help for Ukraine, including ongoing deliveries of security assistance, economic support and humanitarian aid," the White House said in a release. On Twitter, Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. for the support, adding "anti-Russian sanctions" were also discussed. "We must stop the aggressor as soon as possible," he wrote. "The leaders discussed how the United States, along with Allies and partners, is working to hold Russia accountable, including by imposing sanctions that are already having an impact on the Russian economy," the White House said. The Interfax News Agency quoted Russian defense minister on Tuesday that his country will continue its military operation in Ukraine until it achieves its goals, after officials from Russia and Ukraine met with no tangible results. The second round of talks was set to take place on March 2, Tass reported, citing a source on the Russian side. Western powers have threatened to cut Russia from the world's main international payments network SWIFT in the latest move to step up financial sanctions.
