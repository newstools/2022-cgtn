Wild storms lashed New Zealand's North Island Monday, claiming at least three lives when a fishing vessel sank and causing chaos in the country's biggest city Auckland, AFP reported citing officials. Two people were missing after a fishing charter went down off the remote Northland coast late Sunday, with five survivors stable in hospital after being plucked from the raging seas, the police said.
