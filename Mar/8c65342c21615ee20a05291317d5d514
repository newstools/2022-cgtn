Along with the 2022 Winter Paralympics, the mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon has met with athletes and others who attended the Games. Fan Di'an, president of the China Artists Association (CAA) said the design of Shuey Rhon Rhon can resonate with para athletes. "Now that Shuey Rhon Rhon has arrived at the stage, I think people will love it as well," Fan said in an interview with People's Daily. "Especially at the Winter Paralympics, because its warm color will resonate with para athletes." Compared with the Winter Olympic mascot Bing Dwen Dwen, which is like a panda wearing ice clothing, Shuey Rhon Rhon is a red Chinese lantern that represents warmth and light. Both grew very popular during Beijing 2022, which, Fan believes is the sign of Chinese people growing more confident in the country's aesthetic standard. Fan described both mascots as important artistic and cultural success of higher education for fine arts. "The design of Bing Dwen Dwen connects with panda, but also makes a brand new concept," Fan said, "… That's why people love it not only because it's cute, but also because it's like an 'idol' that people can talk to and exchange feelings with." The opening and closing ceremony of the 2022 Winter Olympic Games impressed the whole world. General director Zhang Yimou said he's making "Chinese romance" with the two events. Fan believes this embodied Chinese people's standards, ideal and the pursuit of aesthetic culture. "Our traditional outlook on nature, the universe and life could be found everywhere at both the opening and closing ceremony," Fan said. "The use of the Huangshan Pine for welcoming and willow branch for farewell are both displaying traditional Chinese culture, or the essence of it." Fan said the romance at the two ceremonies could be seen from the natural unfolding of everything, ranging from music and light to the general picture. "Such romance is the perfect expression of a deliberate cultural confidence," Fan said.
