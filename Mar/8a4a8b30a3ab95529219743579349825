China's "dynamic zero-COVID" policy has allowed the country to achieve economic recovery and growth while ensuring the basic stability of the global industrial and supply chains, a spokesperson for China's top political advisory body said on Thursday. Guo Weimin, spokesperson for the fifth session of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the remarks during a press conference, refuting claims that China's coronavirus policy has impacted the global supply chain. The "dynamic zero-COVID" policy is China's overall guideline for COVID-19 prevention and control, which refers to a slew of measures to swiftly stamp out new outbreaks when they happened. The gist is to cut off the spread of new infections as soon as possible, instead of just letting go of the situation and allowing it to run out of control. Under the policy, the scale and global market share of China's foreign trade hit record highs in 2021, injecting strong impetus into global economic and trade recovery, Guo noted.

China's aid is targeted at helping the international community defeat the pandemic as soon as possible and restore normalcy, so as to better promote exchanges between China and the rest of the world, he said. The country will continue to strengthen its COVID-19 aid to developing countries and contribute to building a global community of health for all, the spokesperson added.
