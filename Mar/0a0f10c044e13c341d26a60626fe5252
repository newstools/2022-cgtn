China will encourage financial institutions to lower real loan interest rates and cut fees, in a move to reduce financing costs for market entities, according to the country's banking and insurance regulator. As some industries and enterprises have met difficulties in production and operation by the epidemic, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC) has already implemented policies for micro and small businesses to defer principal and interest repayments on loans, said a statement posted on Wednesday. The CBIRC said it will promote banking institutions to "make full use of various resources" to innovate financial products and continue to improve service efficiency. The regulator will also encourage insurance companies to optimize insurance products and provide insurance protection for losses caused by the epidemic, such as business shutdowns.
