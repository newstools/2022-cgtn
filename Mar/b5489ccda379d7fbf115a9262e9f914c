The Philadelphia 76ers have won six of the seven games in which James Harden played for the team, including five straight wins in a row. During that winning streak, Harden picked back his superstar performance, averaging 24.6 points, 7.6 rebounds, and 12.4 assists. Rarely could any player perform so well immediately after joining a new team that has a totally different playstyle from his previous organization. However, the 29-point loss against the Brooklyn Nets on March 10 wiped all the cheers and flowers, partly because Harden played one of the worst games this season. After that loss, many of those who previously described Harden and Joel Embiid as the next historic guard-center pair began to take shots at Harden and again tagged him as an unreliable player for a clutch time. The victory achieved by Harden and Embiid over the Orlando Magic on Sunday didn't shut those criticisms down. Are they right about Harden's future in Philadelphia or jumping onto a baseless conclusion?
