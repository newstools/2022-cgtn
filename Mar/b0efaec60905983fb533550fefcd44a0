Russian President Vladimir Putin on Sunday said that his country is ready for dialogue with Ukraine and foreign partners, in a phone conversation with Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan. In a statement after a one-hour phone call, the Kremlin said Putin has told Erdogan that any attempt by Kyiv to delay the negotiation process will fail. Military operation will only be halted if Ukraine stops fighting, Putin added. Erdogan urged Putin to declare a ceasefire in Ukraine, open humanitarian corridors and sign a peace agreement, his office said on Sunday. The Turkish presidency said Erdogan told Putin that Turkey is ready to contribute to a peaceful resolution of the conflict, adding a ceasefire would ease concerns over the humanitarian situation. Turkey has intentions of bringing together Ukraine and Russia's foreign ministers for talks at a diplomacy forum next week in southern Turkey. Both Ukraine and Russia have voiced openness to such talks, according to Turkish newspaper Daily Sabah. "President Erdogan renewed his call of 'let's pave the way for peace together'," his office said. "Erdogan emphasized the importance of taking urgent steps to achieve a ceasefire, open humanitarian corridors and sign a peace agreement." Noting that he is in constant contact with the Ukrainian side and other countries, Erdogan said that he will continue his efforts to conduct comprehensive negotiations and achieve results, according to Daily Sabah. Before Sunday, Putin and Erdogan last spoke on the phone on February 23, a day before Moscow launched special military operation in Ukraine. The two leaders also discussed bilateral ties, it said.
