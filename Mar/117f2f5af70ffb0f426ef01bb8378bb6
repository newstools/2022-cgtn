The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) fired an unidentified projectile toward the East Sea, Yonhap News Agency reported on Saturday, citing the Republic of Korea's (ROK) military. The agency said the projectile was suspected by the ROK's Joint Chiefs of Staff to be a ballistic missile launched from a location near Sunan, a district in Pyongyang. The DPRK has carried out multiple missile tests over the last two months and the latest reported launch was the ninth such test this year. Last week, the country said it had "conducted an important test" that supported its plan to develop a reconnaissance satellite. DPRK leader Kim Jong Un has vowed to strengthen his country's military capabilities and build a powerful army.
