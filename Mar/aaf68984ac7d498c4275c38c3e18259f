European Union leaders will discuss ways to quickly ditch Russian fossil fuels, as they convene in Versailles for a two-day meeting. State leaders and senior officials of the 27-nation bloc will meet on Thursday and Friday for the EU Leaders Summit. Reuters cited a draft declaration of the summit as saying the EU will agree to phase out dependency on imports of Russian gas, oil and coal.
