At places over 4,000 meters above sea level, even the toughest shrubs and grasses find it hard to cling on to life. However, despite the hardships, people of China's Tajik ethnic group living in Pamir, northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, have learned to not only survive but also thrive. They have mastered the skill of diverting rivers to irrigate their farmlands. Their story and way of life testifies to the deep well of ancestral wisdom that people in China are able to draw on as they seek to establish a relationship of harmony with the natural world.
