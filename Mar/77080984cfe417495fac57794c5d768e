U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Sunday that return to Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) is the best way to put Iran's nuclear program back in the box, during a joint press conference with Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, according to Reuters. Blinken also said that U.S. also seeks tangible improvement in the lives of Palestinians and would discuss ways to calm tensions in meeting with Palestinian leaders.
