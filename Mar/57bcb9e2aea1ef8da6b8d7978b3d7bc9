Australia said it has begun joint legal action with the Netherlands against Russia at the International Civil Aviation Organization over the downing of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 eight years ago. Russia was responsible under international law for the downing of the flight in July 2014, which claimed 298 lives, including 38 Australians, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Foreign Minister Marise Payne said in a statement on Monday. Moscow has always denied involvement and has promoted a range of alternative possibilities.
