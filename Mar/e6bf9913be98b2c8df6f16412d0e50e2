Women in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region are guaranteed of their lawful rights, including participation in democratic decision-making and personal reproductive autonomy, a Xinjiang representative said on Tuesday. The region "attaches great importance to the protection of women's rights and interests," said Aynur Mahsat, president of the Women's Federation in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, at the 49th regular session of the UN Human Rights Council. Women's reproductive rights are lawfully protected as they can choose personally whether to take precautions or contraception measures, Mahsat said, adding that the government offers safe and reliable maternity services. She also said that with enhanced measures promoting female employment, women in Xinjiang are more likely to be employed. Women from all ethnic groups in the autonomous region are enjoying a constantly improving environment and have played a major role in moving the region forward, she said.
