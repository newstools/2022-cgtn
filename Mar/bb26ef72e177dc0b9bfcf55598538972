The key to democracy lies in whether the people are truly masters of the country, said China's Permanent Representative to the UN Office at Geneva Chen Xu, during the ongoing 49th session of the Human Rights Council in Geneva. Democracy and human rights are the common pursuit of mankind, he said on Friday. Countries differ in history, culture and national conditions, so the choice of forms of democracy is bound to be different. "Promoting and protecting democracy and human rights is the common cause of the international community and should not be used as a tool to put pressure on other countries," he added. Democracy in international relations is the trend of the times, the ambassador said. All countries should promote true democracy, practice multilateralism, advance consultation and cooperation, and promote peace and development, he noted. On human rights, he stressed that people-centered development should be at the heart of the global community's approach to tackling inequality. "We are of the view that development contributes significantly to the enjoyment of human rights. The international community needs to work together to speed up the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and achieve more robust, greener and more balanced global development," he said. States should remain committed to people-centered development, specifically, this means addressing uneven development among countries so that no individuals are left behind, he said. "We call upon all stakeholders to strengthen cooperation to achieve common development, promote the enjoyment of human rights, and bring about a better future for people around the world," he concluded.
