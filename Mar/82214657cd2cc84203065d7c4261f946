The confluence of Dangqu and Tuotuo rivers is a famous place depicted in Chinese novel "Journey to the West." It is called Tongtian River, where Monk Sha once resided. The dividing line between Tongtian and Jinsha rivers is in Zhenda Township, southwest China's Sichuan Province. As the clear water joins the Tongtian River, it rolls and stirs. The water appears golden because of the sediment. Hence it has the name Jinsha, meaning "golden sand."
