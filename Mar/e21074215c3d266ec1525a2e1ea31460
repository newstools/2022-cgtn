Chinese Vice Premier Han Zheng called on the lawmakers from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macao SAR to support local governments in their epidemic prevention and control efforts as well as in further integrating the two cities with the nation's development plans. Han earlier on Monday joined the delegations from Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR, respectively, in deliberations at the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), the national legislature. The vice premier spoke highly of the work of both SARs in the past year, saying they stabilized their economies, ensured people's well-being and maintained social stability. In recent years, the legal system and enforcement mechanism for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong and Macao have improved, Han said, adding the electoral system has improved, "patriots governing Hong Kong" and "patriots governing Macao" have gained solid institutional protection, and democratic practices in the SARS have shown a new trend. He reiterated that the central government is determined to implement the principles of "One Country, Two Systems," "the people of Hong Kong governing Hong Kong," "the people of Macao governing Macao," and a high degree of autonomy. As the daily number of new COVID-19 cases continues to surge in Hong Kong, Han said epidemic prevention and control are the most important tasks for the SAR. Relevant departments of the central government and local authorities should give their full support to ensure the supply of living materials and strengthen medical support, including human and material resources, so as to ensure the stability of people's lives and the general stability of society, he added. Han also called on Macao SAR to consolidate and maintain its hard-won COVID-19 prevention and control achievements.
