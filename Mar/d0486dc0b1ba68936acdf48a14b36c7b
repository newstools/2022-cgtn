China's cycling team are gearing up for the upcoming Hangzhou Asian Games with former world champion Theo Bos joining the coaching team. The five-time track sprinting world champion retired last November. The 38-year-old dominated men's track sprinting for a generation, winning five world titles across the sprint and keirin events. He also won the silver medal at the 2004 Athens Olympics. The Chinese women have been the country's best hope to challenge the world's best on the velodrome track after they successfully defended their title in the team sprint at the Tokyo Olympics last summer. The Dutch cycling legend hopes that more focus will bring them the outcomes they want.
