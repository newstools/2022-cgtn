Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has rejected the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison's move to include the flood-ravaged state in a national emergency declaration, arguing that it should have been done earlier, ABC News reported on Thursday. "The time for that national emergency was probably a week ago, so we've actually gone past that. The floodwaters have gone down," Palaszczuk said.
