"China's dynamic zero COVID-19 policy is the most effective and most responsible," said Wu Hao, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). Wu came to this conclusion as he has participated in the emergent handling of COVID-19 in 11 provinces and has been involved in fighting the pandemic since its beginning. "China's dynamic COVID-zero policy is successful because we have the strong leadership of the Party. We also have the strong support of the general public and also the understanding of the people," Wu said at the "Members' Corridor" this afternoon. Through the use of electronic means and leveraging advanced technology, China has effectively controlled the epidemic, according to Wu. China will follow the development of the virus, dynamically study the disease, and coordinate the economy and different social sectors to maximize the effectiveness of the COVID-19 control policies that are being constantly adjusted accordingly, he said.
