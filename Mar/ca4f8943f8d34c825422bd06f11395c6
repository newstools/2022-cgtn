Villarreal reached the quarter-finals of the Champions League on Wednesday after inflicting a humiliating 3-0 defeat on Juventus in Turin to go through 4-1 on aggregate. Penalties from Gerard Moreno and Arnaut Danjuma, and Pau Torres' tap-in in the final quarter of an hour were enough for Unai Emery's well-organized side to see off the Italians at the Allianz Stadium and make Friday's last-eight draw. "It's a magical night," said Moreno to Movistar+. "We thought we could do it, we've always shown that in the big games we compete, the team gives its best... we all want to be in there with the best in Europe, we're going to keep dreaming and we're going to do it together." Europa League holders Villarreal stunned Juve with three punches after spending most of the match on the back foot, content to hold off the hosts' attacks which got less potent as the match wore on. An embarrassing loss was just Juve's second since the end of November and punctures a dogged run of form which has put them back into the league title race at home. Chelsea coach Thomas Tuchel praised his players for remaining focused amid the uncertainty about the club's future after they progressed Wednesday to the Champions League quarter-finals, where he said they would be "the team nobody wants to play". The reigning European champions came from behind to beat Lille 2-1 in northern France and win their last-16 tie 4-1 on aggregate with Christian Pulisic and captain Cesar Azpilicueta scoring their goals. The victory came on the same day it emerged that the Ricketts family, owners of Major League Baseball team the Chicago Cubs, were leading a consortium looking to buy the club while British athletics great Sebastian Coe announced his involvement in a rival takeover bid. "Can we speak about it when it's confirmed? Let's see. Today I'm happy we are in the last eight," Tuchel said. Chelsea have now played five games since Abramovich put the club up for sale on March 2 and won them all.
