At the Beijing Winter Paralympics, Chinese armless alpine skier Sun Hongsheng caught the attention of many, both onsite and online. On day one of the #Paralympics2020, the 28-year-old said his wish had come true by just finishing his route on the men's downhill standing event at the Games, even though he was well outside the medals. "To me, that's already a success, because in the past, I often fell over myself during competition," Sun said. "So, finishing the event at the Winter Paralympics is the best ever for me," he added. Sun lost his arms after an accident involving a power line at the age of six. But he adapted quickly and went to school like other children, learning to read and to write with his feet. Highly ambitious in sports, Sun joined the Chinese national para skiing team in 2016, which was a huge challenge because skiers normally use their arms for balance. But all the difficulties couldn't stop Sun from chasing his Paralympic dream.
