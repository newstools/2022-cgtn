The Republic of Korea (ROK) test-fired some of its "key missiles" to show "capability and readiness" to counter potential missile threats, said the country's armed forces, following Pyongyang's launch of a suspected intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). "It has been confirmed that in case of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)'s missile launch, (we) have the ability and posture to precisely strike the origin of the missile launch and command and support facilities at any time," stated Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) of the ROK. Calling the DPRK's launch "a serious threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the international community," the JCS said its military is keeping a close eye on Pyongyang's military activities. "Assets mobilized were a Hyunmoo-2 ground-to-ground missile and one Army Tactical Missile System missile as well as a Haesung-II ship-to-ground missile and two JDAM air-to-surface missiles," reported Yonhap, quoting the JCS.
