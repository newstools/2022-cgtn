Boeing on Wednesday unveiled its newest high-throughput small satellite production, integration and test facility designed for efficiency and rapid delivery timelines. Housed in the world's largest satellite factory, Boeing's 92,903-square-meter El Segundo facility, the small satellite production line will be powered by Boeing subsidiary, Millennium Space Systems. The companies are applying advanced and additive manufacturing techniques, including 3D printing entire space-qualified satellite buses, to offer faster cycle times while improving performance, Boeing said in an announcement. Jim Chilton, senior vice president of Boeing Space and Launch, said that "our customers need satellites on-orbit faster than ever. Much like an airplane or auto production line, we're employing lean production principles and advanced manufacturing techniques to accelerate delivery and pass on cost savings to our customers." According to the company, the initial operating capability took place in September 2021, and the smallsat factory's full operational capability is expected in late 2022. Boeing is an aerospace company that provides services such as commercial airplanes, defense, space and security systems, and asset-based leasing and lending services. (With input from Xinhua)
