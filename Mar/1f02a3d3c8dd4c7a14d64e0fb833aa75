When covering the refugees in Ukraine, some Western media showed their sympathy for white, blonde and blue-eyed Europeans, a stark contrast with reporting on refugees in the Middle East and other areas. "This is not a developing third world nation. This is Europe." "They are Christians." "They are white." Despite all being refugees, they are treated differently, which not only shows the prejudice and double standards of some Western media, but also their racial and religious discrimination.
