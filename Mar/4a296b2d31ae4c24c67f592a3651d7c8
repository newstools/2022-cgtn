The Russia-Ukraine crisis is not only considered by many as a major event reshaping global order but also the biggest risk to world stability. Different countries respond differently based on their interests and probably will be affected in different ways. How can we approach the ongoing crisis in an objective and comprehensive manner? When media coverage may be based on a particular point of view or set of values, how can people obtain fair, accurate and impartial information? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited Dr. Laurie Mulvey, director of the World in Conversation Center at Penn State University; Dr. Sam Richards, teaching professor of sociology, also from Penn State University; Professor Madhav Nalapat, vice-chairman of Manipal Advanced Research Group; and Professor Huang Jing, director of the Institute of the U.S. and Pacific Studies at Shanghai International Studies University.
