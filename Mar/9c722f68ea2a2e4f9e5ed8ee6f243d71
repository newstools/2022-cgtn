Gabriel Boric Font, 36, was inaugurated on Friday as Chile's youngest president. The leftist former student leader and legal and social sciences graduate from the University of Chile was sworn in along with his cabinet members during a ceremony at the National Congress in Valparaiso, about 100 km from the capital Santiago. He will serve until 2026. "I am deeply proud of this cabinet, deeply proud that there are more women than men, thanks to the feminist movement. Let us never, never forget that we are indebted every day to the people of Chile," he told the new cabinet. Winning the presidential election with the most votes in Chilean history, Boric also made history by choosing a cabinet filled with youth, feminists and environmentalists. He took office amid the economic and health crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and a historic constituent process in the South American country to replace the country's constitution that dates back to the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet.
