Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Thursday that the Antalya, Turkey meeting was not a substitute to talks between Russia and Ukraine in Belarus, which is the main venue to discuss all specific issues, including demilitarization. Lavrov cited Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba as saying there was no progress on a ceasefire. However, Lavrov said, "a ceasefire was not, in fact, a topic for discussion today."
