Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi met with visiting Abu Dhabi's Crown Prince of Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in the Red Sea Resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Monday. Egypt's presidency said Sisi and Sheikh Mohamed held expanded bilateral talks on issues including economic investment. Sisi stressed Egypt's commitment to security in the Gulf and "rejection of any practices that seek to destabilize it," the presidency said in a statement. For his part, Sheikh Mohamed stressed that his visit to Egypt came as a continuation of the historical and distinguished relations between the two countries. Sisi also hosted Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett in the resort city on Monday, two Egyptian security sources told Reuters. There was no official comment on any talks involving Bennett, but the Egyptian sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the three leaders were holding discussions that covered the consequences of the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. The UAE and Saudi Arabia have resisted Western calls to increase oil output and contain a jump in crude prices caused by the conflict in Ukraine. Egypt faces new economic pressures due to the crisis that saw it devalue its currency by 14 percent on Monday. Bennett traveled to Abu Dhabi in December, the first official visit by an Israeli leader following the normalization of Israel-UAE relations. Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979 and last week announced an agreement on direct flights between Tel Aviv and Sharm el-Sheikh. Bennett visited Egypt last September, the first official trip by an Israeli head of government to the country in a decade. (With input from Reuters, Xinhua)
