China will formulate laws on tariffs and other taxes in 2022, Li Zhanshu, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), said Tuesday in a committee's work report delivered to the second plenary meeting of the fifth session of the 13th NPC. The move aims to improve the "legal system supporting the development of the socialist market economy," said the work report. For this purpose, the country also plans to formulate laws on rural collective economic organizations, energy, futures and derivatives this year, it said. Speaking at the annual parliamentary session about the legislative plan for this year, Li said 40 pieces of legislation had undergone a preliminary review. China's annual legislative plan also includes revising the Company Law, the Enterprise Bankruptcy Law, the Anti-Monopoly Law, the Railway Law, the Mineral Resources Law, the Animal Husbandry Law, and the Agricultural Products Quality and Safety Law, according to the report. He said the government will also revise the laws on protecting women's rights, ecological conservation on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, protection of the Yellow River, and public health emergency response. New laws on preschool education, telecoms and online fraud are also planned in 2022, said the work report.
