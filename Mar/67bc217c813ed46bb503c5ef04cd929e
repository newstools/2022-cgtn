China's para cross-country skiers swept a total of four medals within ten minutes at Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics in Zhangjiakou on Wednesday. The men's sprint sitting final result is an exact repetition of the men's long distance sitting on Sunday, which saw China's Zheng Peng and Mao Zhongwu make a one-two finish, while Collin Cameron from Canada got the bronze medal. Yang Hongqiong, 32, clinched the country's 10th gold medal at the women's short distance sitting in three minutes and 18.2 seconds. This is her second gold, having come first in the long distance sitting as well. The champion from southwest China's Yunnan Province only started to ski in 2018, before which she was a wheelchair basketball player. China's Li Panpan won a bronze medal while her teammate Wang Shiyu finished fourth.
