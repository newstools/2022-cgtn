China stands ready to deepen cooperation with Central Asian countries for controlling the pandemic, expanding industrial capacity, energy, agriculture, people-to-people exchanges, digital economy and green development, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. Wang made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress, China's top legislature. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the five Central Asian nations of Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. The leaders of the six countries held a virtual summit to commemorate the anniversary in January. China's relations with the five Central Asian countries, which are now at a golden age of 30, enjoy a bright prospect of vibrant growth, Wang said. China is ready to make joint efforts with the nations to implement outcomes of the summit and build a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future, he added. "China will continue to follow the principles of mutual respect, good-neighborly friendship, solidarity in trying times and mutual benefit as it works with Central Asian countries to forge a strategic partnership featuring rich substance, fruitful results and enduring friendship and build a China-Central Asia community with a shared future," he said.
