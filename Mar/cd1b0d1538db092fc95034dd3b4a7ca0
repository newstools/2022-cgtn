Chinese Premier Li Keqiang emphasized protecting the legitimate rights and interests of people in the country at a press conference after the conclusion of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress on Friday. Referring to recent incidents of women's rights violations in some localities, Li said that women and children traffickers should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. The premier said that China will keep on improving people's lives as its economy grows. China's fiscal revenue is still tight, even as it reached 20 trillion yuan ($3.16 trillion), Li said. "For 10 consecutive years, we have tried our best to ensure that fiscal funding for education is no less than 4 percent of GDP, which is not an easy task," said Li. The country has established the world's largest basic medical insurance network for 1.4 billion people and is set to increase the subsidy for residents' medical insurance by 30 yuan per person this year.
