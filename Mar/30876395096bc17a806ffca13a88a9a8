China Media Group (CMG)'s documentary "Zhanqi," meaning "battle flags," has been permanently collected by the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution in Beijing. CMG President Shen Haixiong attended the documentary's donation and collection ceremony on Monday. In celebration of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the 100-episode documentary features the troop units awarded with the 100 honorable battle flags. It tells the little-known stories behind those flags through interviews of nearly 100 veterans and their descendants, showing how the CPC-led Chinese people's army fought and marched on the great journey of the new era. It was broadcast on CCTV-7 military channel and other new media platforms between 2021 and 2022, with a viewership of over 300 million, generating over 100 million related topic views on social media.
