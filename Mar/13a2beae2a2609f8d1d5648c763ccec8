Russia's claim that Hunter Biden, the son of U.S. President Joe Biden, helped finance a U.S. military "bioweapons" research program in Ukraine is "at least partially true," the Daily Mail newspaper has reported citing new emails it exclusively obtained. Emails from Hunter's abandoned laptop show he helped secure millions of dollars of funding for Metabiota, a U.S. Department of Defense contractor specializing in research on pandemic-causing diseases that could be used as bioweapons, according to the Daily Mail's website. Emails and defense contract data reviewed by the Dailymail.com suggest that Hunter had a prominent role in making sure Metabiota was able to conduct its pathogen research just a few hundred miles from the border with Russia. The commander of the Russian Nuclear, Biological and Chemical Protection Forces claimed there was a "scheme of interaction between U.S. government agencies and Ukrainian biological objects" and pointed to the "financing of such activities by structures close to the current U.S. leadership, in particular the investment fund Rosemont Seneca, which is headed by Hunter Biden," according to the media outlet. The U.S. has dismissed such allegations as disinformation and propaganda.
