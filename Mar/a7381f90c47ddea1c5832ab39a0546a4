China on Monday urged the United States to honor the one-China principle, stop arms sales to the Taiwan region and sever military links with the island. In response to reports that the Taiwan region has recently signed an arms procurement contract with the U.S. side, Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said China always "resolutely" rejects such moves. The U.S.' arms sales to China's Taiwan region are a "serious" violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 Communique, Zhao told a regular press briefing in Beijing. The U.S. move is also a "serious interference" in China's internal affairs and "seriously" undermines China-U.S. relations and the peace and stability of the Taiwan Straits, he said, urging the U.S. to "strictly" abide by the one-China principle.
