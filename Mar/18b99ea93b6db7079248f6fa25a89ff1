Heavy snow swept the city of Hulun Buir, disrupting traffic and inconveniencing residents. The snowfall was the heaviest since the beginning of this spring, accumulating up to 13 centimeters in Yakeshi, a city of Hulun Buir. Local traffic authorities activated an emergency plan, deploying traffic police to patrol and help on key sections of the snow-struck roads 24 hours a day. Affected by accumulated snow, two expressways have been closed, with coach bus services departing from Hailaer District suspended. Though the heavy snowfall disrupted the traffic, it increased the air humidity, reducing the forest fire risk level in the upcoming spring forest and grassland fire prevention period.
