A record 96 Chinese athletes, 68 male and 28 female, will compete in all six sports – alpine skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, sled hockey, snowboarding and wheelchair curling – at the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, which will start on March 4. It will be the sixth time for Team China to compete in Winter Paralympics. In 2002, China sent a delegation to the Salt Lake City Winter Paralympic Games for the first time in history, with four athletes participating in alpine and cross-country skiing events. The Chinese wheelchair curling team won the country's first Winter Paralympic gold medal at PyeongChang 2018. While China entered the Winter Paralympic arena fairly late, it has a shining record at the Summer Paralympic Games. China made its Summer Paralympics debut in 1984 with 23 athletes, winning 22 medals, including two golds. At the Athens 2004 Summer Paralympic Games, China topped both the gold medal table and medal tally for the first time. After that, Team China has continued to top the charts at Beijing 2008, London 2012, Rio 2016 and the Tokyo 2020 Summer Paralympics. Underpinning the achievement is the improvement in sports services for people with disabilities in China. The proportion of people with disabilities participating in cultural and sports activities increased from 9.6 percent during the 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) period to 10.6 percent in 2020, according to statistics from the China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF). In 2011, a fitness program was launched in China to provide better guidance and services for persons with disabilities. Since then, the General Administration of Sport has supported the CDPF in training social sports instructors for people with disabilities. By 2017, a total of 104,000 such instructors had been trained. Governments and organizations at all levels have increased investment in the building of sports venues for people with disabilities. In 2017, there were 9,053 cultural and sports venues for people with disabilities across the nation, according to a white paper on protecting the rights and interests of persons with disabilities in China released in 2019. Today, the number of Chinese national Paralympic team athletes has grown from fewer than 50 to around 1,000, according to the CDPF. With the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympic Games around the corner, more people with disabilities are getting involved in winter sports. At present, 50 winter sports demonstration facilities for people with disabilities have been established across China. Every year, more than 300,000 people with disabilities participate in snow and ice sports season activities, contributing to China's vision of "engaging 300 million Chinese people with sport on snow and ice."
