At least 22 people were wounded when violence erupted Saturday in the stands of a Mexican football match, which was called off when the clash spilled onto the field. The game, between Queretaro and Atlas at La Corregidora stadium in the city of Queretaro, was in its 63rd minute when fights between opposing fans broke out. As security guards opened the stadium doors to allow fans to get to safety, some instead continued to exchange blows, forcing the game to be stopped and sending the players to the locker room. A VAR monitor was destroyed during the clashes, with images posted to social media showing injured fans lying prostrate. "There is no report of people dead, 22 people injured... two of them seriously," the civil protection for the state of Queretaro said after the match was called off. Liga MX president Mikel Arriola slammed the events on Twitter. "Those responsible for the lack of the security at the stadium will be exemplarily punished. The safety of our players and fans is priority!" Arriola also announced that all matchday games due to be played Sunday were suspended "in solidarity with the people affected" and to prevent any repetition. (With input from AFP)
