The U.S. destroyer Ralph Johnson's sail-through of the Taiwan Straits on March 17 was "dangerous" and sent a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" forces, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command. The theater command remains on high alert to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security, and regional peace and stability, Shi said.
