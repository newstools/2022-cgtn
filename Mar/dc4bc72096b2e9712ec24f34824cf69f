Israeli President Isaac Herzog landed in Ankara on Wednesday on a trip aimed at restarting ties with Turkey, the first high-level meeting between the two countries in years. Before departing Israel, Isaac Herzog said that in talks with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he would seek to "restart" relations undermined by "ups and downs."
