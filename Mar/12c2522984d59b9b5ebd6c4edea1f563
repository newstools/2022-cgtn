The Pakistani military has demanded that New Delhi provide an explanation for what it claimed on Thursday was the crash inside Pakistan of an unidentified high-altitude supersonic object that allegedly originated in India's western Haryana province. "On 9 March a high-speed flying object was picked up inside Indian territory by the Pakistan Air Force," a military spokesman told a press conference on Thursday, adding that the military is unsure about the nature of the object, which endangered civilian passenger flights before crashing near the eastern Pakistani city of Mian Channu.
