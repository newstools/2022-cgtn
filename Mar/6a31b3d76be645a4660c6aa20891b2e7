China Eastern Airlines said it has started the insurance claims process for the families of ill-fated flight MU5735 victims. The airline has organized a team to take care of the insurance claims and will develop compensation plans based on communication with families, the airline said at a press conference on Sunday afternoon. China's top insurance regulator on Tuesday called on all insurers to make all-out efforts to help grieving families with their insurance claims. Flight MU5735 crashed on Monday in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region on its way from the southwestern city of Kunming to Guangzhou. All 132 people aboard the plane are confirmed dead.
