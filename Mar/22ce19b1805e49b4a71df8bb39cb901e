Photographer Lin Ge captured the lovely moments of two nutcrackers frolicking on tree branches in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The bird feeds on pine nuts. They also gather pine nuts to store in tree holes for winter consumption. And, whenever they fly into a new wooded area, they search through for pine nuts hidden by their own kind.
