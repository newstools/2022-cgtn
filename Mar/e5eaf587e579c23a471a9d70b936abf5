New Zealander Alex Wilson has been living in Hong Kong since 2000. He is a video producer who produces a variety of shows and corporate films. One of the things about Hong Kong and why he is still around after 20 years is that opportunities abound and the city is a financial hub. When you meet people in Hong Kong, the scope and scale of opportunities are global. Hong Kong is a link between the Chinese mainland and the rest of the world. He chose to stay because he thinks it's an interesting place with its own vibe and an energy that's different from anywhere else he has been. And people are willing to try new things and present them in a new way. Another part of Hong Kong's charm is its resilience.
