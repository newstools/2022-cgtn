The 2021-22 NBA regular season is only seven to eight games away from ending, but things remain unclear in the Eastern Conference. The top 2 teams, Boston Celtics and Miami Heat share the same record, while the following Milwaukee Bucks and Philadelphia 76ers are only half a game away. What's even more surprising is that some of the above four teams may prefer to rank third instead of first or second in order to avoid meeting the Brooklyn Nets, which may advance to the playoffs via the play-in tournament. Of course, the Nets will have to make sure first that they are not upset by the Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Cleveland Cavaliers or Toronto Raptors. While things are so unpredictable in the top and bottom of the East, the Chicago Bulls, which are likely to finish the regular season in fifth, will have to accept the cruel fact that they are not good enough to contend for the throne.
