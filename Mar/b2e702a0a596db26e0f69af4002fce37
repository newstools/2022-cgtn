To start a business in China now only takes an average of four days, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday, adding that it takes a minimum of one day to get a business license in some places. Li made the remarks in response to a question on China's efforts to improve the business environment at a press conference after the closing of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress, China's top legislature. He underscored efforts made by the Chinese government to streamline administration, delegate power and improve regulation and services in recent years, vowing to spur the vitality of market entities through reforms. More than 1,000 administrative licensing items have been delegated or canceled, and the practice of non-administrative approval has been put to an end, he said. China now has a total of 150 million market entities, 100 million more than a decade ago, the premier noted. Li also stressed the importance of strengthening regulation in areas concerning people's lives, health and interests such as food, medicines, workplace safety and finance.
