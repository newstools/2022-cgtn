China's Yu Jing made her Paralympic debut as the only female ice hockey player of the Beijing Winter Paralympics on March 8, the International Women's Day. Being the only female player on the national team is not an issue for Yu. While the sport is fast-paced and highly physical, her male teammates treat her like their little sister, according to Yu. "They are taking care of me and protecting me on a daily basis. I feel like a giant panda being taken care of by everyone." Featured in a victory for Team China against Team Italy 6-0 in the preliminary round on Tuesday, Yu became only the third woman in history to play Para ice hockey in the Winter Paralympics – after Norway's Brit Mjaasund Oeyen and Lena Schroeder. "I am feeling really good right now," the 38-year-old said in a post-match interview. "I was able to compete against Italy on this special day. It makes me feel meaningful as well. This is a perfect day for me." A former wheelchair basketball player from east China's Shandong Province, Yu started training in ice hockey only two years ago. "At first, I didn't have any idea about the sport, but when I tried it for the first time, it really made me happy. That is why I continued." Yu wants to encourage more women to participate in this sport through her Paralympic presence. "There are many girls in China who would like to join the sport and many are already in. I am the representative of these female players. I got the chance to play for the national team and be on this stage to show the world the power of Chinese women."
