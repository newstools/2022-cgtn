Chinese pair Xu Yifan and Yang Zhaoxuan won the women's doubles at the BNP Paribas Open as an unseeded pair in Indian Wells. The victory was Xu's eleventh doubles title on the WTA Tour and her second at the 1000-level. Last week, before competing in the Miami Open, the 33-year-old talked to Sports Scene's Wang Dong about her experience at Indian Wells and her future plans.
