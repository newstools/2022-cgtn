Chinese para skier Zhang Mengqiu made history at the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympic Games by clinching China's first alpine skiing gold in the women's super-G standing event. "I just want to challenge and surpass myself," the 19-year-old said after finishing her winning run in 1:13.54 on March 6. It was the second medal for Zhang, after her silver in the women's downhill standing event on March 5. The Chinese paralympian added another silver medal in the women's super combined standing competition on March 7. During the Games' opening ceremony on March 4, Zhang was one of the athletes' representatives who took the Paralympic Oath in Beijing. Zhang, who has motor dysfunction caused by cerebral palsy, joined north China's Hebei provincial para-team in 2016 and was selected to the national team a year later. Having overcome daunting difficulties and trained hard with determination and persistence, Zhang outraced many competitive skiers in giant slalom standing, winning China's first-ever World Cup gold in 2020.
