China has become the country with the largest growth in forest resources in the world, according to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration. The country's forest area has reached 220 million hectares, and the forest stock volume has exceeded 17.5 billion cubic meters. And these two figures have kept growing over the past thirty years. The growing forest resources is the result of implementation of several key forestry ecological projects, such as the coastal shelter forest project, the shelter forest system project in Three-North Regions of China and the project to protect natural forests. Moreover, more than 300 ecological protection and restoration projects are carried out in key areas across China, and the construction of 40 pilot and demonstration projects for land greening are underway. "These projects have served as an enhanced protection system for our country," said Zhang Wei, director of the department of ecological protection and restoration of national forestry and grassland administration," it also provided important ecological support for the Yangtze River Economic Belt, the high-quality development of the Yellow River (basin) as well as the integrated development of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei."
