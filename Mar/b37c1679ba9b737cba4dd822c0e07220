Denmark midfielder Christian Eriksen scored on Tuesday on his return to the Copenhagen stadium where he suffered a cardiac arrest last year. The Dane, wearing the captain's armband, struck in the 57th minute to round off Denmark's 3-0 friendly win against Serbia at Parken Stadium, where he collapsed and nearly died in a European championship match against Finland last June. "To come back to Parken and score a goal with the welcome I received, and still receive, is something that gives you goosebumps. It makes me incredibly happy," Eriksen told Danish television at the end of the match between two teams which have already qualified for this year's World Cup in Qatar. Joakim Maehle opened the scoring for Denmark after a quarter of an hour with Jesper Lindstrom adding a second eight minutes after the break. Eriksen scored the third with a shot from outside the box for his 38th goal in 111 appearances. He was substituted after 80 minutes, leaving the field to a standing ovation and was later named man of the match. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has said he will continue playing international football for "as long as possible" despite Sweden's failure to qualify for the 2022 World Cup. The 40-year-old came on as a substitute for the final 10 minutes in Sweden's 2-0 playoff loss to Poland in Chorzow on Tuesday. Ibrahimovic has endured an injury-hit season and will be 42 by the time of the next major international tournament he could play in, Euro 2024 in Germany. "I will continue as long as I can," the AC Milan striker told a press conference. "You won't get a different answer here just because we didn't win this match and we didn't qualify for the World Cup. That goes for the national team, and also for Milan." Ibrahimovic only came out of international retirement last year after initially hanging up his boots for Sweden following Euro 2016.
