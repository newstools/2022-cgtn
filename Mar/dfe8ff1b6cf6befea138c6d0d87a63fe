Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday that China will make the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) a "belt of development" to the benefit of the world and a "road to happiness" for people of all countries. Wang made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress. He said China will work with the international community to continue advancing high-quality Belt and Road cooperation, aiming for higher-level cooperation, better cost-effectiveness, higher-quality supply and stronger development resilience. The joint construction of the Belt and Road has maintained a sound momentum despite shocks from several factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, Wang said. Since last year, 10 more countries have signed Belt and Road cooperation documents with China, increasing the Belt and Road family to 180 members, he said. With more partners, stronger foundation and brighter prospects, the BRI is sure to create new development opportunities for the post-COVID world, according to Wang.
