For decades, U.S. engagement in the Middle East, from Iran and Iraq to Afghanistan and Syria has been called an "endless war": no end in sight. But with the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, will there be a turning point for peace for the region? What legacy does the U.S. leave behind? And how will its Middle East policy change in the future? To discuss these issues and more, we've invited John Ross, senior fellow from the Chongyang Institute for Financial Studies at Renmin University of China; and Professor Faiz Zaland from Kabul University.
