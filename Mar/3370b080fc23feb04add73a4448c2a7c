World Meteorological Day, which reminds people how the earth's atmosphere and human behavior are intertwined, is observed on March 23. It's also a day to commemorate the establishment of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), a United Nations specialized agency. This year's theme, "Early Warning and Early Action," highlights the importance of hydrometeorological and climate information for disaster risk reduction. Here are a group of photos showing different meteorological phenomena. (All photos via CFP) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
