Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has met India's National Security Advisor, Ajit Doval, in New Delhi. Wang said the two countries should stick to their development paths and work to safeguard peace and stability around the world. To achieve this, he has proposed a three-point approach. First, both sides should view their bilateral ties from a long-term perspective. Second, they should look for win-win opportunities in each other's development. And third, they should embrace multilateralism and cooperation. Ravinder Bawa in Delhi has more.
