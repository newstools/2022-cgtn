Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine reduced the risk of Omicron infection by 31 percent among children aged 5 to 11, and by 59 percent among adolescents aged 12 to 15, according to a study published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday. The study looked at 1,364 children in Arizona, Florida, Texas and Utah who submitted weekly nasal swabs and surveys from July 2021 through February 2022, regardless of whether they had COVID-19 symptoms. Approximately one half of Omicron infections in unvaccinated children and adolescents were asymptomatic, according to the CDC. The Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was recommended by CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices for adolescents aged 12 to 15 on May 12 last year, and for children aged 5 to 11 years on November 2.
