Zhang Yesui, spokesperson for the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC), on Friday highlighted the importance of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in developing China-U.S. relations, saying that China's policy towards the U.S. is consistent and clear-cut. He made the remarks when answering a question on China-U.S. ties during a press conference. Zhang stressed that stable China-U.S. ties are good for both sides, and are conducive to maintaining a peaceful and stable international environment as well as effectively addressing global challenges such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic. The spokesperson pointed out that the key to peaceful coexistence is mutual respect, calling on the two sides to respect each other's social systems and development paths, respect each other's core interests and major concerns and respect the basic principles such as the principle of non-interference in internal affairs. Win-win cooperation serves the fundamental interests of two nations and two peoples, Zhang said, adding it is also the shared aspiration of the international community. With regard to the recent China competition bill passed by the U.S. Congress, the spokesperson said taking China as a strategic rival will only undermine the China-U.S. mutual trust and cooperation and eventually hurt the United States' own interests. Zhang also underscored that drawing lines based on ideology and forming small circles to seek bloc confrontation are all acts against the trend of times, warning these acts will lead to nowhere.
