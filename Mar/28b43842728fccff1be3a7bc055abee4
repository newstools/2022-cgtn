A Polish animal charity is offering assistance to pets evacuated from Ukraine, where violence and destruction continue. ADA Foundation, run by Radek and Jakub, has been operating for 30 years in Przemysl, a Polish city near the border with Ukraine. The charity normally gives shelter to abandoned animals like cats, dogs, goats, and even bears. But their priority now is to provide food and medical assistance to pets evacuated from Ukraine. Since the beginning of the Ukrainian conflict, they have treated over 300 animals brought in from Lviv. Once these animals arrive in Poland, they are subject to quarantine, as most of them need to be vaccinated and registered with some in need of treatment for wounds and dehydration.
