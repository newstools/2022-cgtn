Gas prices in Europe broke all records to reach about $3,900 per 1,000 cubic meters on Monday, Russia Today reported. The April futures at the TTF hub in the Netherlands soared to $3,899 per 1,000 cubic meters or nearly $374 per megawatt-hour in household terms by 10:00 GMT, the media outlet reported citing data from London's ICE exchange. Russia is a leading supplier of natural gas and one of the world's biggest crude producers. Brent prices also spiked to their highest levels since 2008 on Monday to $139 per barrel, after the west allies said they are exploring banning imports of Russian oil. Russian state energy giant and major gas exporter, Gazprom said Monday it continues to routinely supply Russian gas for transit to Europe through the territory of Ukraine, Russia Today reported.
