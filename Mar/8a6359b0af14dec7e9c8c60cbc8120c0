U.S. President Joe Biden has held a phone call with his European allies ahead of his trip to Europe. The White House said Biden and his counterparts in France, Germany, Italy and the UK have expressed concern over the current conflict in Ukraine and voiced their support for the country. Biden will meet NATO leaders this Thursday. He will also participate in an EU summit to discuss sanctions on Russia. Biden will then travel to Poland, where thousands of U.S. troops were deployed and many refugees have been sheltered after fleeing Ukraine.
