Britain's Queen Elizabeth II felt well enough from COVID-19 to undertake two virtual audiences on Tuesday, Reuters reported, citing a Buckingham Palace source. The Palace later tweeted pictures of the Queen seeing incoming ambassadors from Andorra and Chad via video link from Windsor Castle. The British monarch, 95, has been fully vaccinated against coronavirus and was previously said to have been suffering mild cold-like symptoms after testing positive for the virus. Despite cancelling some events she continued with light duties after testing positive. (With input from agencies)
