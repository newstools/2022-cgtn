China will provide an additional 10 million yuan (roughly $1.6 million) of humanitarian assistance to Ukraine, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin announced on Monday. Wang said at a daily press briefing that the new aid package was based on the development of the situation and the needs of Ukraine. "China pays close attention to the civilian casualties in the Russia-Ukraine conflict," Wang said, noting that the top priority for the international community now is to deal with a possible large-scale humanitarian crisis. He added China has put forward a six-point initiative on alleviating the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and has taken concrete actions, including providing humanitarian aid supplies. "China will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine and stands ready to make its own efforts to overcome the humanitarian crisis," said Wang. The Red Cross Society of China earlier provided humanitarian aid supplies worth 5 million yuan to Ukraine.
