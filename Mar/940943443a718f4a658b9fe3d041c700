China has fulfilled its commitment of delivering a streamlined, safe and splendid Olympics to the world, which has been highly praised by the international community, said Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday. He made the remarks when replying to a letter from Thomas Bach, president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). This is a success for the Chinese people, Xi said. Through the Beijing Winter Olympics, more than 300 million people in China participated in ice and snow sports, injecting new impetus into building a healthy China and promoting people's well-being, and opening up broader prospects for the development of ice and snow sports around the world, he said. Noting that this is also a success for the people of the world, Xi said that athletes from all over the world have performed to perfectly demonstrate the new Olympic motto of "Faster, Higher, Stronger - Together". He also thanked Bach and the IOC for their firm support for the Beijing Winter Olympics, saying that the Chinese government is ready to maintain close cooperation with the IOC and will continue to support the work of the IOC. Bach recently sent a letter to President Xi congratulating Beijing on the successful 2022 Winter Olympic Games. This is a valuable legacy of the Beijing Winter Olympics, which has ushered in a new era of global winter sports, he said. The Beijing Winter Olympic Games fulfilled its solemn commitment, achieved its goals with the highest standards, and ensured the safety of all participants, he added.
