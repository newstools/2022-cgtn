CGTN's music project "Music Voyage" is back again with an international collaboration to promote the Olympic spirit. Three artists have joined hands to compose the new track, "Tiger's Eye." British songwriter Shaun Gibson wrote the lyrics, while British singer Katie Sky and Chinese artist James Lee provided powerful vocals. The song was created using Music Voyage's Winter Olympic theme tune "Embrace," which was produced in a ground-breaking relay format leading up to the opening of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics by four musicians from around the world during a month-long collaboration.
