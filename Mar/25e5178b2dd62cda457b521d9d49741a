Russia says it hopes the ongoing talks with Ukraine will be more active and substantive. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia would not make public its detailed demands to Ukraine. Peskov also refuted U.S. warnings that Russia may be preparing to conduct cyber attacks in response to Western sanctions. He said his country does not engage in "state-level banditry," unlike many Western countries.
