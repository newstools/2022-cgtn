Civilian safe passage from Ukraine's besieged eastern port city of Mariupol was "halted" on Sunday for a second consecutive day, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said. "A second attempt today to start evacuating an estimated 200,000 people out of the city came to a halt," the ICRC said. Mariupol city council has also confirmed the suspension, saying Sunday's planned evacuation of civilians is not possible due to "Russian shelling." There is no comment from Russia yet.
