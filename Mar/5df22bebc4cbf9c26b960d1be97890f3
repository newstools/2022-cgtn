China's securities regulator on Thursday pledged to spare no effort to maintain the stable operation of the capital market, releasing another positive signal to bolster investor sentiment. China will advance efforts in solving key and sensitive issues considering capital market expectations as well as ecological and environmental issues, according to a meeting chaired by the head of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) Yi Huiman. The commission emphasized on stability, saying that it will fully implement relevant measures to support the economic operation and the development of small, medium and micro enterprises. The CSRC said on Wednesday that it will encourage listed companies to increase their holdings and buy back shares. It will also guide fund companies to purchase their own shares. The commission added that it will support all kinds of eligible enterprises to list overseas and will try to reach an agreement on China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation as soon as possible.
