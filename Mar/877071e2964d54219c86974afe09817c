UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Friday called on all parties to take concrete actions and accelerate the political process to end the Syrian conflict, which entered its 11th year on March 11. "The past 11 years of brutal conflict have exacted an unconscionable human cost. Syrians have been subjected to human rights violations on a massive and systematic scale. The destruction that Syrians have endured is so extensive and deadly that it has few equals in modern history. There must be no impunity," he said in a statement. "We must not lose hope, we must act now. We must show the courage and determination to move beyond rhetorical commitments to peace and to do all that is necessary to reach a negotiated political solution in line with Security Council resolution 2254 (2015)." He also called for greater humanitarian access to address the needs of people throughout the country. "My message is clear: We cannot fail the Syrian people. The conflict must cease. International humanitarian law must be respected. I call on all parties to meaningfully engage in the UN-facilitated political process and appeal for further support to scale up the humanitarian response. We must choose peace," he added.
