British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan discussed cooperation between the two countries on energy security, green technology and trade, Johnson's spokesperson said on Wednesday. "The leaders ... discussed opportunities to increase collaboration between the UK and UAE on energy security, green technology, and trade," the spokesperson said in a statement. "They also agreed on the need to bolster our strong security, defense and intelligence cooperation in the face of growing global threats." Johnson arrived in the UAE on Wednesday as part of his tour in the region. He will then travel to Riyadh, capital of Saudi Arabia. The prime minister is using the trip to seek help with the energy crisis and persuade Gulf states to boost their own production of oil and gas, reported UK media.
