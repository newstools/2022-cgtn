A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday refuted U.S. State Secretary Antony Blinken's accusations that China's unwillingness to condemn Russia's "special military operation" is inconsistent with China's position on the UN Charter. China always stands for respecting the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all countries and abiding by the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, Zhao said during a regular press conference. Blinken's China-smearing remarks fully revealed the U.S. side's Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation thinking, Zhao said, adding that such remarks will not help solve the problem. On the Ukraine issue, China has always adopted an objective and fair attitude and made judgments independently based on the merits of the matter itself, the spokesperson reiterated, adding that China believes the security concerns of all countries must be taken seriously and supports all efforts that are conducive to the peaceful settlement of the crisis. As a responsible, major country, China will continue to play a constructive role in maintaining world peace and stability, Zhao said. He said the U.S. government's decision on NATO's eastward expansion is directly related to the current Ukraine crisis and stressed that the key to solving the crisis lies in the hands of the U.S. and NATO. As the initiators of the crisis, the U.S. and NATO should reflect on their role in the crisis, effectively assume responsibility, and take practical action to de-escalate the situation and solve the issue, Zhao said. He also called on the U.S. to work together with the majority of the developing countries in the world, stand on the side of peace and justice and promote the early de-escalation of the situation in Ukraine.
