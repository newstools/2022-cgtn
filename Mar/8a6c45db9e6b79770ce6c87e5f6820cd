One person died and several others were injured in an attack on a nine-story residential building in Donetsk on March 30. One survivor told CGTN that his mother was still buried in the rubble and there was no new information. Another witness said the surroundings suddenly lit up when the attack took place. She said she couldn't imagine what would have happened if she had gone out to work two minutes earlier, leaving her child alone at home.
