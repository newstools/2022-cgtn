Taikonauts in China Space Station (CSS) hosted their second space class for youngsters on Earth. The live-streamed educational session is a part of China's effort to take full advantage of the CSS with an aim to inspire young minds to pursue science. The three taikonauts at the space station, including commander Nie Haisheng, first female CSS taikonaut Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu participated in the session on Wednesday. This is the third such event the country has hosted from space and the second one from the CSS. The first class in space was held in the Shenzhou-10 spacecraft, before the CSS was built. For the lecture, three classrooms housed local students in Beijing, the Tibet Autonomous Region and the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region where the students could interact with astronauts in real time. The lecture was also broadcast on national TV to reach a wider audience. The lecture covered a series of experiments that demonstrated the crystallization process, surface tension, separating water and oil, and momentum in space. Multiple scientific equipment currently at the station were also displayed during the lecture.
