The top diplomats of the U.S. and four Arab countries convened in Israel on Monday in a display of unity against Iran but also used the rare summit to press their host to revive long-stalled peacemaking with the Palestinians. Israel said the event would be repeated and expanded as it builds up commercial and security ties with other Sunni Arab states. Iran has not yet commented on the remarks.
