Huge crowds of Sudanese protesters on Monday managed to break the security cordon and reach the gates of the Republican Palace in capital Khartoum to demand civilian rule. Mass rallies took place in the capital and other cities on Monday, where protesters demanded civilian rule and called on authorities to punish alleged killers of protesters, eyewitnesses said. The police forces who used tear gas against the protesters were compelled to retreat from their station points, while military forces lined up in front of the Republican Palace gates and at the entrances of the roads surrounding the complex without interfering with the protesters, according to the eyewitnesses. The protesters chanted slogans, calling on the army to hand over power to a civilian government, repeating "power is for the people, and the military for the barracks." In Bahri town, however, the protesters could not cross the bridge linking the town with Khartoum because of the security barricades, together with tear gas, sound grenades and water cannons used by security forces, according to eyewitnesses. In Omdurman, security forces also managed to prevent protesters from crossing the bridge linking the city with Khartoum. The Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors (a non-governmental organization) said that a protester was killed by a gunshot to the head in Omdurman on Monday and dozens were injured in Khartoum. But no official source has confirmed the deadly incident as yet. Sudan has been suffering a political crisis after the army's general commander Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on October 25, 2021 and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. Since then, opposition groups have been staging regular mass protests in Khartoum and other cities to demand civilian rule.
