Sanxingdui Museum in southwest China's Sichuan Province has reopened to the public after renovation. The new exhibition, themed "The Dance of Man and God – Mysterious Bronze Kingdom," is a comprehensive and systematic display of the bronze cultural relics of Sanxingdui, reflecting the spiritual world of the ancient Shu people, who lived there over 3,000 years ago. It uses advanced technologies, like virtual reality and open-eye 3D, to offer visitors an immersive experience of life among ancient Shu people.
