The World Health Organization has advised Ukraine to destroy high-threat pathogens stored in the country's public health laboratories. In a statement to Reuters, the WHO said this could prevent "any potential spills" that would spread disease among the population. Ukraine has public health labs researching how to mitigate the threats of dangerous diseases. The WHO said it encourages all parties to cooperate in "the safe and secure disposal of any pathogens they come across, and to reach out for technical assistance as needed."
