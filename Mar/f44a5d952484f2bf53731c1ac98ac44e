Since the conflict started in Ukraine three weeks ago, about five million Ukrainians have been forced to leave their homes, either to other parts of the country or outside Ukraine altogether. Now, one out of every eight Ukrainians is displaced. Chris Melzer, spokesperson for the UN refugee agency, told CGTN about Ukrainian baby Andrii, who became a refugee at just six weeks old. His mother and aunt brought him with them and fled from Kharkiv to Poland while his father stayed back.
