Astronauts aboard China's space station will hold a new science class on March 23, the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) announced Friday. Last December, Shenzhou-13 astronauts – Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu – gave their first lecture from the space station. The livestream will include a series of experiments that demonstrate the crystallization process, surface tension, separating water and oil, and momentum in space. The crew members will also introduce the scientific equipment currently in the station. The class will be broadcast to viewers worldwide via China Media Group channels.
