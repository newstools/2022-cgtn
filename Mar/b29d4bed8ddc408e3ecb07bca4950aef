Companies engaged in online gaming, livestreaming, audio and video content in China should set up a "youth mode" to protect minors, according to draft regulations issued on Monday by the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). The draft underlines the importance of having a system that prevents the users from developing an addiction. It also requires service providers to not have product designs that may induce addiction. It asks major platforms for regular assessments on cyber protection for minors to provide a "clean" online environment, besides capping daily amount of time spent on the platforms by minor users. China's major video streaming platforms Tencent Video and iQIYI as well as ByteDance-owned short video platform Douyin have already launched a "youth mode" for minors. Last year, China introduced new rules that limit the amount of time minors under 18 years of age can spend on video games to three hours a week, a move it said was necessary to combat gaming addiction. The draft is now available on the administration's website, and feedback is welcomed through to April 13. (With input from Reuters)
