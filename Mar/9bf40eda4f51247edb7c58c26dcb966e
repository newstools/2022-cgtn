New car registrations in Europe deteriorated further in February, after hitting a record low in January, as supply chain disruptions continued to hurt the automotive sector across the region, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) showed on Thursday. The number of new vehicles registered in the European Union, Britain and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) fell by 5.4 percent to 804,028 in February, marking the eighth consecutive month of decline, ACEA's data showed. Car registrations varied strongly between individual countries, with a decline of 22.6 percent and 13 percent in Italy and France, respectively, compared with growth of 6.6 percent and 3.2 percent in Spain and Germany.
