Astronauts aboard China's space station will give another class in the coming days, the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) announced Tuesday. Shenzhou-13 astronauts – Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Ye Guangfu – livestreamed their first science lecture from the space station on December 9, 2021, which brought China's manned space program closer to young people and sparked their enthusiasm for space exploration and knowledge. The second space class will cover topics solicited from the public, the CMSEO noted. The Shenzhou-13 crew entered the Tianhe core module of China's space station on October 16, 2021, embarking on a six-month stay in space, which is China's longest-ever crewed mission. They are expected to return to Earth in mid-April.
