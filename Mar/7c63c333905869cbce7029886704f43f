China's Foreign Ministry on Monday called on all parties to take actions that are conducive to de-escalating the Ukraine situation, and to promote dialogue instead of intensifying conflicts. Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks at a daily press briefing after U.S. President Joe Biden declared that Vladimir Putin "cannot remain in power." Several U.S. officials later clarified that the U.S. does not have a policy of regime change in Russia.
