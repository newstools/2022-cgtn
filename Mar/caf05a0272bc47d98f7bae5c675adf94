Team China retained the wheelchair curling gold medal after defeating Team Sweden 8-3 in the final match of the 2022 Winter Paralympics at the National Aquatics Centre on Saturday. Four years ago, at PyeongChang 2018, the Chinese team won the event as it was their only gold in that edition of the Winter Paralympics. Both sides played it safe in the first four ends during which Sweden led 2-1. China got down to business in the fifth end when Zhang Mingliang's deliver locked four points for the team. As Viljo Petersson-Dahl's last delivery for Sweden failed to work, China went back on top 5-2. Sweden cut the deficit to two in the following end, but Wang Haitao accomplished an excellent double takeout in the seventh, leaving three Chinese stones in the house and extending the lead to 8-3. Sweden conceded after this end and China were crowned again the Winter Paralympic champions of the event. "When you do it right, winning the gold is nothing but natural," Wang said. China's 2022 Winter Paralympic journey in wheelchair curling had a bumpy start with two straight losses. However, the team bounced back aggressively with 10 consecutive wins in the following competitions. They trailed in multiple ends in different matches, but were always able to come back and pocket the final victory. Their resilience and calmness made them a dominant squad.
