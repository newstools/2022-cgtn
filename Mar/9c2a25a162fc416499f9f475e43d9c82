According to Russia's Defense Ministry, Ukraine's air force is practically destroyed. Chief spokesman Igor Konashenkov said Russian forces have destroyed over 2,200 military infrastructure targets in Ukraine since the military operation began. These targets include command posts, anti-aircraft missile systems, and radar stations. His men also destroyed nearly 1,000 armored vehicles, including aircraft and tanks. The spokesman warned Ukraine's neighbors not to host Kyiv warplanes, or Moscow could consider them part of the conflict.
