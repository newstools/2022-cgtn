The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. said Friday that the U.S. should immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies, after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) added two Chinese telecom operators to its "list of communications equipment and service providers deemed threats to U.S. national security." The two companies are China Telecom (Americas) Corp, and China Mobile International USA Inc. "The FCC abused state power and maliciously attacked Chinese telecom operators again without factual basis. China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese companies," said the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. Meanwhile, the FCC on March 17 revoked the authorization for two Chinese telecom companies, Pacific Networks and its wholly-owned subsidiary ComNet, to provide telecommunications services in the country. "China firmly opposes the U.S. violating the basic principles of non-discrimination and fair competition, and the recognized international economic and trade rules. The U.S. should immediately stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies, and create a fair and stable market environment for companies from all over the world," Gao Feng, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, said at a press conference on March 17.
