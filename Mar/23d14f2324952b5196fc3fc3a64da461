The construction of a new museum to help protect the cultural relics unearthed at the Sanxingdui heritage site has begun in Guanghan City. The new museum lies close to the Ancient Sanxingdui site. With a history dating back more than 3,000 years, the Ancient Sanxingdui site is known as one of the greatest archaeological discoveries of the 20th century and was part of the Yangtze River civilization.
