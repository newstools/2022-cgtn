Despite the surging COVID-19 cases in east China's Shanghai and nearby cities, the value of foreign trade via China-Europe freight trains in the city of Yiwu jumped by 5.3 percent from January to February this year. Yang Rongcheng, dispatcher of Madrid-Yiwu China-Europe Railway Express, and Luo Huayi, deputy general manager of Yiwu Land Railway Port Development, talked with CGTN about the railway. The express has been one of the most important lines to link China with Europe. It spreads across 13,000 kilometers through France, Germany, Poland, Belarus, Russia and Kazakhstan.
