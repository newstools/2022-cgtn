Various videos of rare wild takins were captured by infrared camera while they were strolling and foraging at a nature reserve in northwest China's Gansu Province. Takins are usually found in alpine zones, at altitudes of 2,500 meters above sea level. They feed in the late afternoon, grazing on a variety of leaves and grasses, as well as bamboo shoots and flowers. Takin is listed as Vulnerable on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List and is among the first-class national protected animals in China.
