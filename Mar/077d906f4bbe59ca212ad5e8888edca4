The Indianapolis Colts are trading their quarterback (QB) Carson Wentz to the Washington Commanders for two draft picks and one swap, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter. Schefter revealed that the Colts will receive the third-round picks of the Commanders for 2022 and 2023. If Wentz plays 70 percent or more of the team's snaps in the 2022 season, the third-round pick for 2023 will be upgraded to a second-rounder. Moreover, the Colts will exchange their No. 47 pick with the No. 42 pick of the Commanders for 2022. Wentz's $28 million of salary for 2022, including a $5 million roster bonus, will be fully paid by the Commanders, reported Schefter. Wentz will be the ninth Washington QB in the past three years. His predecessor Taylor Heinicke passed for 3,419 yards and 20 touchdowns (TDs) with 15 interceptions and a 7-8 record. By contrast, Wentz threw for 3,563 yards and 27 TDs with seven interceptions for the Colts last season. However, Wentz passed for only 333 yards and two TDs with one interception in the team's last two games of the regular season, including the loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars in the last week. That loss not only cost the Colts the playoff qualification, but also will be remembered as the "clown game" for a long time. When the Colts acquired Wentz from the Philadelphia Eagles in February 2021, they gave up their first- and third-round picks. Though the assets they received from the Commanders were hardly the same valuable, at least they will compensate part of their losses. The Commanders at first were trying to land Russell Wilson from the Seattle Seahawks by offering three first-round picks, according to ESPN's John Keim. Nonetheless, they were outbid by the Denver Broncos, which reached "the biggest deal" with the Seahawks for Wilson. Here's what the Broncos gave up: QB Drew Lock, tight end Noah Fant, defensive lineman Shelby Harris, two first-round picks for 2022 and 2023, two second-round picks for 2022 and 2023, a 2022 fourth-round pick and a 2022 fifth-round selection, according to ESPN.
