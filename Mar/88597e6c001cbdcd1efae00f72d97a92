Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Saturday that Ukrainian forces didn't allow Russia to evacuate foreign students from Kharkov and that authorities in Ukraine's Kherson refused Russian humanitarian aid. Russia's Defense Ministry Friday said its troops are offering humanitarian assistance to Ukrainian residents and have delivered over 140 tonnes of foodstuffs and medications to Kherson. Speaking at a joint press conference with his Kyrgyz counterpart Ruslan Kazakbaev, Lavrov told reporters that Russia strikes exclusively at Ukraine's military infrastructure, which poses a threat to Russia. He noted that Russian troops have been ready to provide humanitarian corridors since the start of the military operation and Ukraine is not averse to holding foreigners and its civilians as hostages and human shields. Lavrov said the Russian side has not yet received information from Ukraine on the timing of the third round of negotiations. He noted that the "militaristic frenzy" of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy indicates that he does not need the talks with Moscow but that Russia hopes his mood changes. He also hit at Zelenskyy's remarks over NATO's refusal to a no-fly zone over Ukraine, saying that Zelenskyy is trying to provoke a conflict between Russia and NATO. According to Lavrov, if Zelenskyy is upset about NATO's refusal to meddle in the conflict, it means the Ukrainian president is hoping the alliance would be the one to resolve it.
