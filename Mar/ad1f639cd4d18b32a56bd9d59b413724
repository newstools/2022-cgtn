The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) appeared to have fired four suspected projectiles from multiple rocket launchers into the Yellow Sea, Yonhap News Agency reported on Sunday, citing military officials of the Republic of Korea (ROK). "This morning there was firing in North Korea [the DPRK] which is assumed to be multiple rocket launcher shots, and our military was monitoring the related situation and maintaining a readiness posture," the ROK's Joint Chiefs of Staff said in a statement, without elaborating. The DPRK military fired four shots at around 7:20 a.m. (2220 GMT on Saturday) for about an hour toward its west coast from an unidentified location in South Pyongan Province, according to the Yonhap report. The National Security Council of the ROK held an emergency vice-ministerial meeting over the launches. The DPRK has yet to comment on Sunday's firings, which came just days after it carried out what the ROK said was a failed launch of an unidentified projectile. Pyongyang conducted seven missile tests in January and launched components of what it said was a "reconnaissance satellite" on February 27 and March 5.
