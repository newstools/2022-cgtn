Thousands of Tibetan antelopes were spotted in Gerze County, southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, earlier this week. Inhabiting the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, the animal is heavily protected in China. Over the past few decades, the country has made great strides in working to protect the species, which was once regularly hunted. (Video: Courtesy of Sonam Rigzin)
