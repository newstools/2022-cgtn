The Dashanbao Black-necked Crane National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Yunnan Province is one of the main wintering spots for the cranes, and the number of the birds that arrived here last winter broke records. With the temperature rising, the black-necked cranes are gradually taking off on their journey to their northern breeding spot. Since the ecological environment has been gradually turning better, the number of the black-necked cranes wintering here has reached to 1,926 from 300 in 1990. The nature reserve is part of the East Asia-Australasia Flyway, one of the world's great flyways. Black-necked cranes who spend their winter in other places of the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau also make a stop in the reserve to replenish energy during their annual migration. The population of black-necked cranes in China has exceeded 17,000, recent data shows.
