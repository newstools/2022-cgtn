China will compete in Group A with USA, Belgium, Bosnia and Herzegovina, South Korea and a team to be confirmed (TBD) at the 2022 FIBA Women's Basketball World Cup in Australia. The TBD team will be confirmed by FIBA's Central Board from the Washington/Santo Domingo Qualifying Tournament. Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Serbia and Nigeria are in Group B. The tournament will happen between September 22 and October 1 at two venues, Sydney Super Dome and State Sports Centre, in Sydney. The top four teams of each group will be qualified for the quarterfinals and then go through another draw to decide the matchups for the semifinals. China, as the only Pot 1 team of Asia, secured the qualification foe the 2022 World Cup with three straight wins over Nigeria, Mali and France in the qualifiers in Belgrade, Serbia. Having participated in the World Cup for the first time in 1983, China's best record in the event was runner-up in 1994. In the last World Cup in Spain, the Chinese franchise finished sixth under coach Xu Limin. This time, coach Zheng Wei is motivated to aim for a better result in Australia. China were knocked out in the quarterfinals by Serbia at the Tokyo Olympics and then pocketed the silver medal in the 2021 FIBA Women's Asia Cup after losing to Japan in the final. Despite the two losses, Chinese players showed they were capable of competing with the world's top teams. What they needed was a convincing victory over one of the powerhouses at a major tournament to solidify their confidence. This will be the second World Cup for China's starting center Li Yueru. "I hope we can achieve a better result than the last time (in 2018)," she said.
