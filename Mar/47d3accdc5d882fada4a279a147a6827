Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan is facing a no-confidence challenge in parliament. The opposition says he has mismanaged the country's economy and foreign policy since coming to power in 2018. Khan claims that a "foreign-funded conspiracy" is behind the motion, which will be debated in the National Assembly over the coming days.
