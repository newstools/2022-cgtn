Facilities from the Beijing Winter Olympics including the award plazas in Yanqing and Zhangjiakou will be re-used for the Paralympics and the conversion of the two plazas has been completed with all signs and logos switched to the Paralympics. During the Winter Paralympics, the Yanqing Award Plaza will run for seven days to hold award ceremonies for 27 events. Meanwhile, a total of 44 award ceremonies will be held in the National Biathlon Center and Genting Snow Park in Zhangjiakou, meaning that the Zhangjiakou Award Plaza will hold 10 awards ceremonies a day at most. Local departments and staff members have made efforts on the connection between the two ceremonies.
