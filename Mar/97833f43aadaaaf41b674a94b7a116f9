Chinese rescuers are inching closer to the recovery of a crashed plane's second flight data recorder, also known as a black box. Authorities say they have retrieved the emergency locator transmitter that was close to where the second black box was installed. The first of the two black boxes, a cockpit voice recorder, was recovered on Wednesday and data is being extracted. The flight with 132 people on board crashed on Monday in the country's southern Guangxi. So far 120 of them have been identified. Rescuers have recovered some human remains and part of the plane's wreckage. Investigators say no explosive traces have been detected yet. No survivors have been found as the search operations continue, but rescuers are not giving up hope.
