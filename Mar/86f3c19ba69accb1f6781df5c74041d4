An impeachment vote in Peru on Monday failed to gather enough support to oust President Pedro Castillo. Overall, 55 lawmakers out of 130 in the unicameral Congress voted in favor of the impeachment, failing to match the required 87 votes to oust Castillo. The president was accused of corruption and moral incapacity.
