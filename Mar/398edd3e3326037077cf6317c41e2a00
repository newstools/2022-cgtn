The route of the torch relay for the Beijing Winter Paralympics has been released by the Organizing Committee. The flames will be lit by seeds from eight separate sites in three competition zones, Beijing, Yanqing, and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province. They will be combined into a single flame on Wednesday at the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. The torch relay will run through Friday. Some 600 torch-bearers will participate.
