Russia on Tuesday announced that it would impose sanctions against U.S. President Joe Biden. In a statement, the Russian Foreign Ministry said the sanctions, effective on March 15, applied to a total of 13 people, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley. The move was a reciprocal response to America's sanctions against senior Russian officials, said the ministry.
