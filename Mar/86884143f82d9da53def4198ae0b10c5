The Chinese mainland is committed to the one-China principle and firmly opposes any separatist activities seeking "Taiwan independence," Premier Li Keqiang said on Friday, adding that common development opportunities will continue to be shared with Taiwan compatriots. Li made the remarks at a press conference after the conclusion of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing. He stressed that the mainland is committed to the 1992 Consensus and it will advance peaceful growth of cross-Strait relations and the reunification of China. Li said compatriots on both sides of the Taiwan Straits are members of one big family and have a fraternal bond that at no time can be severed, and added "we will continue to share development opportunities with our Taiwan compatriots." "We will provide Taiwan compatriots coming to work on the mainland with equal treatment and we will also take concrete measures to benefit them and help them resolve difficulties," the premier said. "I believe that when people on both sides of the Strait come together and forge ahead in unity, we will be able to promote the peaceful growth of cross-Strait relations and share the well-being of the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
