A bright blue kingfisher tosses a fish in its beak. After catching its prey, the bird landed on a tree branch above the stream before smacking its catch on the branch. The kingfisher then threw the fish in the air making sure it swallowed it head first so the fins and gills did not get stuck in its throat. The bird then waited a few minutes to digest before flying off to patrol its territory in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, UK.
