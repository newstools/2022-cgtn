The ice sheets formed on the waters of Sayram Lake during the winter months in the Bortala Mongol Autonomous Prefecture of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region have started melting with the arrival of the spring season. The lake, a crucial stopover for wild swans during their northern migration, covers an area of more than 450 square kilometers. The Sayram Lake, located to the north of Mount Tianshan, often looks crystal blue and is known as "the last teardrop of the Atlantic." It is the farthest place reached by the warm and humid air currents of the Atlantic Ocean.
