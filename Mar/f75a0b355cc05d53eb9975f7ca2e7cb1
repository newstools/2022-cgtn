World champion Max Verstappen bounced back from his Bahrain disappointment to steer his Red Bull to a thrilling victory ahead of Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in Sunday's Saudi Arabian Grand Prix. The 24-year-old Dutchman, who failed to finish due to a fuel problem in the opening race, won by just half a second after the pair swapped positions in a tense battle through the final laps. It was the closest race finish since the 2020 Italian Grand Prix. Verstappen said it had been very close and he had also reveled in the contest. "I just managed to get in front and to stay there, but it was a great race." "So close. Disappointed with 2nd today but the fight was fun! Let's keep pushing," Leclerc said via Twitter. Leclerc's Ferrari teammate Carlos Sainz finished third ahead of Sergio Perez in the second Red Bull, the top four proving to be in a class of their own. Mercedes new boy George Russell came home fifth ahead of Alpine's Esteban Ocon and McLaren's Lando Norris with Pierre Gasly taking eighth for AlphaTauri. Kevin Magnussen finished ninth for Haas. China's Zhou Guanyu finished 11th, one spot behind seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton who only managed a single point in 10th after a mixed evening. "Messy race, with a few issues…Secured P11 in the end. We'll bounce back stronger for the next race!" Zhou said via Twitter. (With input from AFP)
