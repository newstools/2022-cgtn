The Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen said it carried out airstrikes against "sources of threats" in the Yemeni cities of Sanaa and Hodeidah to stop attacks on its oil facilities, according to Reuters. The coalition said that its goal is to protect the global energy sources from hostile attacks and to ensure supply chains. Local media has reported that eight civilians were killed, while four others, including children and women, were injured during the airstrikes.
