Taiwan region is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory, and the U.S. should stop interfering in China's internal affairs and take concrete actions to safeguard the overall interests of China-U.S. relations, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Saturday. Wang made the remarks during a phone call with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. At present, advancing and implementing the consensus reached by the two heads of state during their video meeting last year remains the most important thing in China-U.S. relations. However, the recent words and deeds from the U.S. side run counter to the objectives, Wang added. The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue. Stressing that China supports Russia and Ukraine to solve the issue through negotiation, Wang said that China's position on the Ukraine issue is based on the merits of the matter concerned. The resolution on the Ukraine crisis should be in accordance with the purposes and principles of the UN Charter, Wang said. He said all countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity should be respected and China welcomes negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to resolve the crisis.
