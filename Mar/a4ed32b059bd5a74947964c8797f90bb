Bayern Munich, Manchester City, Liverpool and Real Madrid became the first four teams to reach the quarterfinals in the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League on Tuesday and Wednesday. City basically spent 90 easy minutes on the field waiting to advance after a 0-0 draw with Sporting CP. Bayern made an aggressive statement, returning to their best form with a 7-1 win over Red Bull Salzburg. Liverpool still advanced to the next stage despite their 1-0 loss to Inter Milan, but the Italian club showed enough resilience to leave with their chins up. Real not only achieved a 3-1 comeback win over Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), but also showed why they are a legit title contender, not the fragile PSG.
