China on Friday called for maximum restraint from relevant sides in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and efforts to prevent a humanitarian crisis of an even larger scale in Ukraine. Zhao Lijian, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said China is deeply worried about the worsening humanitarian situation in Ukraine and saddened by the reported increase in civilian casualties and refugees. The pressing task now is to achieve a ceasefire, Zhao said at a regular press briefing. He urged all parties to "exercise maximum restraint, guarantee the safety and basic humanitarian needs of civilians, and prevent the occurrence of a larger-scale humanitarian crisis." The Red Cross Society of China has provided Ukraine with three batches of humanitarian supplies, with the third batch targeting the needs of displaced children, he noted. "We welcome any initiative or measure from any party that contributes to alleviating and resolving the humanitarian crisis in Ukraine," he said. Zhao also commented on China's position on the Ukraine crisis at the press briefing on Thursday. "China supports all efforts conducive to realizing de-escalation and political settlement and opposes any act that is counterproductive to reaching diplomatic resolution or even leads to escalation," he said when answering a question about Chinese Ambassador to Ukraine Fan Xianrong's remarks a day earlier. During his meeting with regional leaders in Lviv in western Ukraine, Fan said China is a friend to Ukraine and that it stands ready to help Ukraine grow its economy. "We of course support our ambassador's statement," Zhao said. "We will continue to play a constructive role in easing the situation in Ukraine and stand ready to contribute our efforts to overcoming the humanitarian crisis," he added.
