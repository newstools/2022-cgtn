Methuselah is an Australian lungfish thought to be the world's oldest living aquarium fish. The fish, which likes to eat fresh figs, was brought to the San Francisco museum in 1938 from Australia. It's about 90 years old with no known living peers. The fish is a primitive species and is considered the evolutionary link between fish and amphibians.
