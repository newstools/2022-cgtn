China's top political advisory body on Friday called its members to reach out to people from all sections of the society to promote unity. "We should earnestly fulfill the responsibility and mission entrusted by the new era to the CPPCC, remain committed to striking the right balance between commonality and diversity, make effective use of our institutional strengths to expand common ground and achieve the greatest possible convergence of interests," Wang Yang, chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, said while delivering a Standing Committee of the CPPCC National Committee work report at the opening meeting of the fifth session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee. Wang stressed promoting harmony in relations between political parties, ethnic groups, religions, social strata, and compatriots at home and abroad. "To strengthen unity throughout the Chinese nation, we must give better play to the consultative strengths of the CPPCC," he said.
