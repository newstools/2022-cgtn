China has never interfered in the internal affairs of Afghanistan and never sought selfish gains or a sphere of influence, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a meeting with Afghan Taliban officials in Kabul on Thursday. Wang met with Acting Deputy Prime Minister Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar and Acting Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi of the Afghan Taliban's interim government earlier in the day. His visit comes ahead of the third Foreign Ministers' Meeting among the Neighboring Countries of Afghanistan, which is now being prepared by the Chinese side. China and Afghanistan are friendly neighbors linked by mountains and rivers and bilateral exchanges spanning over a thousand years, Wang said. He said China respects Afghanistan's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, respects the independent choices of the Afghan people, and respects Afghanistan's religious beliefs and ethnic habits. Citing the Afghan saying that China is the only major country that has never harmed Afghanistan, Wang said China is willing to continue the traditional friendship between the two peoples and develop normal, friendly and good-neighborly relations with Afghanistan  based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. He said China is willing to help Afghanistan become independent, achieve independent development, and take Afghanistan's future and destiny into the Afghan people's hands. The Chinese foreign minister arrived in Kabul from the Pakistani capital Islamabad, where he attended a two-day meeting of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation.
