Named after the famed river in London, Thames Town is located about 30 kilometers from the center of the east China metropolis Shanghai. With buildings, pubs and shops designed in British fashion, the town offers a slice of the UK in China. Completed in 2006, the town is part of Shanghai's "One City, Nine Towns" initiative, a project where city planners build communities for residents to live outside of Shanghai, relieving the city's population pressure. From a Gothic style church to statues along rows of shops, and even telephone booths, the town combines a variety of British elements into a small community.
