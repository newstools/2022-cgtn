Netflix has suspended its service in Russia following the country's military operation in Ukraine, U.S. publication Variety reported on Sunday. Earlier last week, Netflix temporarily stopped all future projects and acquisitions in Russia as it assessed the impact of Moscow's military action in Ukraine. "Given the circumstances on the ground, we have decided to suspend our service in Russia," the report quoted a Netflix spokesperson as saying. A growing number of multinational businesses have cut off Russia from vital financial services, technology and a variety of consumer products in response to Western economic sanctions. U.S. credit card companies Visa, Mastercard and American Express all said over the weekend they would cut service in Russia. South Korea's Samsung Electronics, a major supplier of both smartphones and computer chips, said it would halt product shipments to the country, joining other big tech companies such as Apple, Microsoft, Intel and Dell.
