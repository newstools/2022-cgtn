The central government is deeply concerned about the life, health and safety of residents in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and will fully support Hong Kong in fighting the COVID-19 epidemic, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said during a press conference in Beijing on Friday. Li said China remained steadfast in the commitment to fully and faithfully implement the principles of "One Country, Two Systems," under which the people of Hong Kong administer the city with a high degree of autonomy. The central authorities fully understand and support the decision of the HKSAR government to postpone the election of chief executive, the premier said. The election shall be carried out in strict accordance with the relevant provisions in the Basic Law, he said. "We hope that the SAR government will unite and lead people of across sectors in Hong Kong to continue to develop the economy, improve people's lives, consolidate and elevate Hong Kong's status as the international financial, trading and shipping center, and maintain long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong," Li added.
