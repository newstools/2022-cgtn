As the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympics comes to an end, many athletes who have finished their competitions expressed their happy feelings about the Games. Benjamin Daviet, French men's Para biathlon sitting gold medalist, talked about the track facilities and venue services. "The track facilities and the service of the venues here are very good, and the building construction is also very beautiful. I had a good experience here, and the athletes' facilities inside are also very complete. I won the gold medal for the first time and I feel very happy." Josip Zima, Croatia's Para cross-country skiing athlete, spoke highly of the village, environment and track. "This place is very good, both the Winter Olympic Village and the surrounding environment are very good, as well as the track. I will miss it. If there is a chance, I would like to come back again, and then skate a few more times on this track."
