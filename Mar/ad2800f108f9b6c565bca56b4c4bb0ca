A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Wednesday slammed "Taiwan independence" forces, calling them the source of jeopardizing the peace and stability of cross-Strait relations. Any attempts to "seek independence" are futile, said Zhu Fenglian, the spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, when asked to comment on Taiwan authorities' recent challenge to the "one-China principle." The fact that the mainland and Taiwan both belong to China has never changed, Zhu stressed. "Taiwan is an inseparable part of the Chinese territory," she said. On October 25, 1971, at its 26th session, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758 with an overwhelming majority. It decided to restore all lawful rights of the People's Republic of China in the UN and recognize the representatives of its government as the only legitimate UN representatives of China. The practices of all those years have proved that officials from the UN and UN member countries recognize that there's only one China in this world, the spokesperson said. "No one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity," she added.
