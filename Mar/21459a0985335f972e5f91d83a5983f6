The prevention-and-control effort in China's COVID-19-hit northeastern city of Changchun is being supported by a huge team of volunteers. One of them is Xiao Jianrong, from east China's Zhejiang Province. He happened to be visiting a friend when the city was suddenly locked down. He's been dedicating his time to helping with nucleic acid testing.
