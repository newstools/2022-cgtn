The National Alpine Skiing Center in Beijing's Yanqing District will host about 200 athletes in 30 medal events during the 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, with the men's and women's downhill events staged on Saturday. Infrastructure and services have been adapted for a more inclusive and accessible edition for the Winter Paralympics after the conclusion of the Winter Olympics two weeks ago. Cable cars have been adapted to serve athletes with disability and seats inside can be lifted to provide more space. Ramps have been installed based on the accessibility criteria set by the International Paralympic Committee. "We already built 19 permanent and four temporary barrier-free lifts, and 20 ramps before the Winter Olympics. During the transition period, we built three more ramps," according to Zhao Yu, accessible facilities manager of the National Alpine Skiing Center. "There are now a total of 18 permanent, 35 temporary and nine portable accessible toilets in the venue." Winter Olympic venues had under two weeks to transition for the Paralympic Winter Games. The organizers said it was a challenge to finish all the tasks within a short period of time and all the efforts have paid off. "The venue is amazing. It's a real Paralympic venue compared to PyeongChang. I was there four years ago. And it's very accessible. I had not seen any stairs I must go off. The lifts are well prepared. I have no complaints," Dutch Paralympic alpine skier Jeroen Kampschreur said. "The venue is great, although I think the slope is a bit challenging to me. I'm trying to adapt. The accessibility level is also very high. Volunteers here are always ready to help," said Chinese Paralympic alpine skier Chen Liang.
