Jordan's King Abdullah II landed in Ramallah on Monday to meet Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas on his first trip to the Israeli-occupied West Bank since 2017, Abbas's office said. Abdullah's visit comes as foreign ministers from four Arab states joined an unprecedented meeting hosted in Israel, a gathering Israel hailed as "historic," following a series of normalization agreements last year, which angered the Palestinians.
