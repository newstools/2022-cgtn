China's para alpine skier Zhang Mengqiu is looking forward to standing on the podium for a fifth time on Saturday after claiming two gold and two silver medals at the ongoing Beijing Winter Paralympic Games.  The para-athlete from north China's Hebei Province took golds in women's giant slalom standing and women's super-G, and silvers in women's downhill as well as super combined.Zhang, who suffers functional movement disorder caused by cerebral palsy, surprised viewers by styling four different hairdos at award ceremonies to show her confidence, beauty, as well as optimism towards life. After celebrating her 20th birthday at the Paralympic Village on March 9, Zhang expressed her gratitude in the simplest words, "I love alpine skiing. It makes me happy." She won a gold medal and a silver when she competed her first national competition in the 2017-2018 season, before advancing to the international arena. "I first went to New Zealand where I got to know the difference between skiing courses and gained competition experience there. I then went to Europe for European Cups and World Cups. The competition there made me see the huge gap between myself and other international athletes. I knew that I had to work even harder to catch up.""In each and every competition, my goal is neither the second place or the third. I love the color of gold," she said. Her father, Zhang Haijian, said the whole family was happy she realized her dream. "She is always very excited about the Paralympics. When she called us before, she said she had envisioned her winning medals. She has made it now."China had never won any medals in para alpine skiing at the Paralympics before, so every achievement is a breakthrough. Zhang had aimed at the gold at the women's slalom race on Saturday. And, of course, she is ready with a new look atop the podium.
