Frederique Turgeon was one of the para-alpine skiers Canada sent to the Beijing Paralympic Winter Games. The three-time championship medalist broke her leg during a training session at Yanqing National Alpine Skiing Center, and had to return to Canada before the opening of the Games. The athlete said the only wish she had before going home was taking a picture with a giant Paralympic mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon. Some volunteers helped grant that wish.
