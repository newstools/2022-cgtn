Kate Caithness, president of the World Curling Federation (WCF) praised Beijing 2022 for the excellent venues, facilities, and services, especially in curling competitions, in an interview with CGTN. "The people have been wonderful, the volunteers, the safety issues. Everything has just been really excellent. I cannot say how proud you guys should be of what you've done here in Beijing," she said. According to Caithness, the curling competitions and the athletes' performance had been exceptional. She cited the men's final during the Beijing Winter Olympics between Team Sweden and Team Great Britain as an example, saying it was one of the best games she had ever seen. Caithness also praised the National Aquatics Center, also known as the Ice Cube, which has hosted both curling and wheelchair curling matches, for its accessible facilities. She went on to praise China's effort in promoting curling and making records in the Winter Olympics and Paralympics. "As far as China is concerned, they spoke about 300 million people being introduced to winter sports. And I understand it's 346 million. Just tremendous from our aspect, from curling," she said. "We have signed a tripartite agreement with the Water Cube or Ice Cube, Chinese Curling Federation, and the World Curling Federation, and this is our legacy," the WCF chief said.
