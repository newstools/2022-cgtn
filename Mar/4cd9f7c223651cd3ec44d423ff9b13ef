Shanghai has announced a two-phased, five-day, citywide mass testing period to curtail the resurgence of COVID-19. The eastern and southern areas of the Huangpu River began closed-off management on March 28. Nucleic acid tests are being carried out in residential communities, and residents must stay indoors until April 1. The western areas of the Huangpu River are scheduled to start closed-off management from April 1 to 5. To feed a megacity with 25 million people, grocery stores are working with communities to ensure residents have enough food at home. During the closed-off management, designated ambulances will take residents in need of emergency medical care to hospitals.
