A domestic flight of Boeing 737-800 jetliner carrying 132 people crashed into a mountainous area in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region at about 2:38 p.m. BJT on Monday. All-out rescue operations are underway, and casualties are still unknown as none of the people onboard have been found so far. Here are some facts about the Boeing 737-800 jetliner and its operator China Eastern Airlines. The Boeing 737-800 is part of the 737 family, the world's most-flown commercial aircraft series. It was developed in the 1960s to serve short- or medium-range routes. The 737-800 is part of the 737 NG (Next-Generation) family, which has a strong safety record after nearly three decades of flights. More than 7,000 of the series have been delivered since 1993. The 162- to 189-seat 737-800 was launched on September 5, 1994. The NG is the predecessor to the 737 MAX that was grounded worldwide for 20 months after two fatal crashes killed 346 people. It remains grounded in China. The jetliner involved in the China Eastern accident en route from Kunming, capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, to Guangzhou, capital of southern Guangdong Province, has been in service for six years, according to Flightradar24, a global flight tracking service. In the United States, American Airlines has the most 737-800s in operation with 265, followed by Southwest Airlines with 205 and United Airlines with 136, according to Cirium data. The last fatal 737-800 crash occurred in August 2020 when an Air India Express plane overshot the table-top runway and crashed while landing at Calicut International Airport in the southern state of Kerala in heavy rain, killing 21. A government report cited pilot error as the probable cause. (With input from Reuters) Check out more about history record of accidents involving Boeing 737-800
