The Eurasian jay can be found in a large range from Europe to Asia. They perennially live in coniferous forests and broad-leaved forests. In winter, they occasionally appear near residential areas to search for food. In breeding periods, they mainly feed on beetles, moths and other insects. In autumn, winter and early spring, they feed mainly on pine nuts, chestnuts, berries and seeds. Here are some lovely photos of Eurasian jays taken by photographer Lin Ge in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. Check them out.
