China vows to step up efforts to ensure the production and supply of key agricultural products, Premier Li Keqiang said when delivering a government work report on Saturday. The country plans to double down on developing and applying scientific and technological breakthroughs in agriculture, Li said at the opening meeting of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress (NPC) at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing. The premier also stressed that a sufficient amount of good land will be designated as permanent basic cropland and forbidden to be used for other purposes, to ensure the expanse of farmland in the country remains above the redline of 120 million hectares. The nation will step up efforts to upgrade low- and medium-yield cropland, as well as increase the area of high-standard cropland by 6.67 million hectares, according to Li. The report said China will keep supporting grain growers by implementing measures including raising the minimum purchase prices of rice and wheat, keeping stable prices of agricultural supplies and providing subsidies for farmers. "We will see that hog production is better regulated and ensure the production and supply of livestock, poultry and aquatic products and vegetables," Li added. The premier also announced that China will speed up the development of the seed industry and carry out the third national survey of soils.
