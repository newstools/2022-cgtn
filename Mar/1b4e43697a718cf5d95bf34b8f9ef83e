The first phase of construction on east China's largest condensate gas field, Bozhong 19-6, began in Shandong Province on Saturday. It is the first 100 billion-cubic-meter gas field in China's Bohai Bay. The project is expected to include eight individual structures – a central platform, three unmanned wellhead platforms and four jackets – at three sites in Qingdao and Tianjin Municipality.
