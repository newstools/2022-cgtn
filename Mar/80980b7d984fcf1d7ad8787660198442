The Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) will fully promote the implementation of the general plan for building a Guangdong-Macao in-depth cooperation zone in Hengqin, a member of the 13th National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said at a meeting of the fifth session of the 13th CPPCC National Committee on Monday. The plan, issued in September 2021, aims to create a special zone on Hengqin island to boost cooperation between south China's Guangdong Province and Macao, which will generate strong impetus for the long-term development of the SAR. Hengqin is located in the southern part of Zhuhai City in Guangdong Province, just across the water from Macao. The implementation of the plan will inject new momentum into the steady and long-term practice of "One Country, Two Systems," Liu Chak Wan, CPPCC member from Macao SAR, said. It will be carried out by focusing on diversifying the industries in Macao, he added. Liu called on entrepreneurs in Macao to actively invest in sectors they specialize in, accumulate social resources, promote employment for Macao residents and help the youth start businesses. The SAR will also enhance education, research, medical care and social services, aiming to attract more talents to settle down in the cooperation zone, Liu said. An array of cooperation plans in economic, industrial, educational, technological and cultural sectors are under implementation, he said.
