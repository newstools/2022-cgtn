Russia announced Thursday an export ban on more than 200 types of foreign products and equipment until the end of 2022, as part of Moscow's response to sanctions imposed over the Ukraine conflict. "The list includes technological, communication and medical equipment, vehicles, agricultural machinery and electrical equipment – more than 200 types of goods in total," according to an order signed by Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin. Russia is a major exporter of oil, gas, grain and metals, and commodity prices have surged since the conflict started two weeks ago. (With input from AFP)
