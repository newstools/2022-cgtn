Germany is rapidly reducing its energy dependency on Russia which applies in particular to the coal and oil sectors, according to a report released on Friday. Germany's Economy Minister Robert Habeck said that "dependency on Russian oil will now drop to around 25 percent; these changed supply chains will already take effect in the coming weeks. Russian oil imports to Germany are expected to be halved by the middle of the year. By the end of the year we aim to be almost independent." Meanwhile, the German Bundestag on Friday obliged gas operators from now on to guarantee gas reserves before the onset of winter.
