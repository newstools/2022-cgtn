Roman Abramovich will soon sell Chelsea. During the 19 years under his ownership, the club has won 21 titles, the most in Premier League in that period. Almost every year, the names of Chelsea and Abramovich were connected with the most expensive player on the market, partly because they usually brought that player to Stamford Bridge. Every two to three years, the name Abramovich was connected to a fired manager whose pocket was filled with compensation money, partly because Abramovich has never been a patient boss. Having spent billions of pounds for Chelsea and taken the team to their most glorious time in club history, Abramovich has left enough legacies for people to recall in the future decades.
