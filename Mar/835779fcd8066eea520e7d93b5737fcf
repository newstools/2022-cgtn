The Bank of England on Thursday raised interest rates for a third meeting running. Eight out of nine members of the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) voted to raise the bank rate to 0.75 percent from 0.5 percent, following the U.S. Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to raise borrowing costs for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic.
