The UN Security Council voted on Thursday to establish formal ties with Taliban-run Afghanistan, which has yet to win widespread international recognition. It did so in approving a resolution that does not use the word "Taliban" and spells out the new one-year mandate of the UN political mission in Afghanistan, which it said was "crucial" to peace in the country. The vote was 14 in favor, with one abstention, by Russia.
