Senior Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi will meet U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in Rome, Italy, on Monday, according to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. The two sides will exchange views on China-U.S. relations as well as international and regional issues of common interest, he said. In October last year, Yang and Sullivan held talks in Zurich, Switzerland, agreeing to bring relations back to the right track.
