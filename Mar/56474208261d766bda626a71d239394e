The Taiwan question differs in nature from the Ukraine issue as Taiwan has always been a part of China, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a press conference on Monday."Some people, while being vocal about the principle of sovereignty on the Ukraine issue, have kept undermining China's sovereignty and territorial integrity on the Taiwan question," Wang said. "This is a blatant double standard." The root cause of the tension is Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority refuses to uphold the one-China principle and attempts to change the status quo that both sides of the Taiwan Straits belong to same China, Wang said. By fabricating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" and distorting Taiwan's history, ultimately they will ruin Taiwan's future, he said. To contain China's revitalization, some forces in the U.S. encourage the "Taiwan independence" forces and challenge the one-China principle, seriously violating the basic norms of international relations, and undermining the peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. Those behaviors will not only push Taiwan into a dangerous situation but also bring unbearable consequences to the U.S. side, Wang said. Wang stressed that the two sides across the Taiwan Straits share the same history and cultural roots, and belong to one China. Taiwan's future relies on the peaceful development of cross-strait relations and China's reunification, rather than some external empty promises, he said. The attempt of relying on foreign forces to seek independence has no future and the plan of using Taiwan to control China is doomed to failure, Wang said. "Taiwan will eventually return to the motherland."
