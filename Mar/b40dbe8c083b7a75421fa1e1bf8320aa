China will launch two lab modules, two cargo spacecrafts, and two crewed spaceships with six Chinese taikonauts into China's space station in 2022, Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's human space program, said on Friday at the first Member's Corridor ahead of the opening of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) 's annual session. He told the press that the Shenzhou-13 crew has been in-orbit for nearly 140 days, the members are in good condition and will return to earth next month. Zhou said the crew's return marks the conclusion of the space station's key technology validation phase. China will enter the construction phase of the space station in May. The Shenzhou-14 crew will welcome two lab modules while they are in orbit. Their major tasks include monitoring and controlling the rendezvous and docking and transposition process of the lab modules. The Shenzhou-15 crew will be sent to the space station by the end of 2022 to join the Shenzhou-14 crew, Zhou added.
