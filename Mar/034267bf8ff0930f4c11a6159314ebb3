China will promote scientific and technological innovation through further implementation of long-term plans and incentives, Premier Li Keqiang said on Saturday. The country will press ahead with a 10-year action plan on basic research and implement a three-year action plan for improving a management system to raise its capacity for innovation, Li said as he delivered the government work report at the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing. The central government encourages local governments to increase their spending on science and technology development, according to the premier. Apart from government support, the development of venture capital, new financial products and services will also be encouraged to promote scientific and technological development, he said.
