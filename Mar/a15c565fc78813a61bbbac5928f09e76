The 31st edition of the FISU World University Games is now less than 100 days away, and to mark the milestone on Friday, the organizers unveiled the design of the medals at a ceremony in the host city Chengdu.Two of China's most popular Olympic gold medalists, gymnast Zou Jingyuan and diver Shi Tingmao, took part in the festivities to publicly reveal the medal design called "Rongguang," which translates into "Light of Chengdu." The medals feature a "Sun and Immortal Birds" layout that echoes the emblem of the Chengdu Universiade. The birds' readiness for flight signifies movement into the future, which corresponds with the event's official slogan "Chengdu Makes Dreams Come True." Along with the medals, the podium, tray, and mascot for the awards ceremonies were also introduced. The Chengdu Universiade will open on June 26 after a one-year delay due to the coronavirus pandemic.
