The fast pace and frequent contact in para ice hockey requires players to wear protection during games, but there are still lots of injuries. The National Indoor Stadium has been equipped with a professional medical team to provide safe and efficient treatment for all the athletes. According to Zhi Deyuan, the medical manager of the National Indoor Stadium, for the patients that team doctors have less confidence to deal with, they have senior trauma surgeons who can tidy up the wound and do the suture. They have 103 medical staff members in the team, including five for wheelchair and artificial limb repair and 20 first-aid personnel. Forty percent of the team members are associate chief physicians or even higher level. Half of the members have first-aid experience. Their goal is to provide safe and efficient treatment as well as friendly and caring psychological counseling.
