Throngs of whooper swans are making their way northward after wintering for four months at the Whooper Swan National Nature Reserve in Rongcheng City, east China's Shandong Province.More than 3,000 swans have already embarked on the migratory journey as the weather turns warm, according to staff members of the reserve.In early March, tens of thousands of whooper swans flew to their breeding ground in Siberia. The nature reserve joined the East Asian-Australasian Flyway Partnership (EAAFP) Flyway Network this February. There are now 20 EAAFP Flyway Network sites in China."Joining the Flyaway Network sites not only helps Rongcheng increase its reputation, but also has a profound impact on the conservation of wetlands and wetland biological resources," said Chen Lu, a staff member of the reserve.
