The China-Russia relationship is based on non-alliance, non-confrontation and non-targeting of any third party, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. "The China-Russia relationship is valued for its independence," Wang told a press conference on China's foreign policy and international relations, which was held on the sideline of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress in Beijing. It is free from interference or discord sown by third parties, he added. Wang said the China-Russia relationship is driven by strong internal dynamics and there are bright future prospects for the two nations. "China and Russia will maintain strategic focus and steadily advance our comprehensive strategic partnership of coordination for a new era," he said.
