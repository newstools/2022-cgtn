Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said there are no "debt traps" between China and Africa, but "monuments of cooperation," when asked about China-Africa relations at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress on Monday. "China honors its commitment to cooperation with Africa, and never makes empty promises," Wang said. "We will champion the spirit of China-Africa friendship and cooperation, and work with African countries to vigorously advance anti-COVID cooperation with Africa, further upgrade China-Africa practical cooperation and act on the Outlook on Peace and Development in the Horn of Africa."
