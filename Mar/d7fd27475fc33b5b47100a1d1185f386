Russia is satisfied with the Istanbul negotiations, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday in Tunxi, east China's Anhui Province. Lavrov said the most important issues for Russia are to ensure that Ukraine stays neutral, remains a non-nuclear state and stays out of NATO. He made the remarks when he briefed the media on the sidelines of the third meeting of the foreign ministers of Afghanistan's neighboring countries. Earlier in the day, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi held a meeting with Lavrov. "We (had a) very smooth discussion today," Lavrov told CGTN's reporter Dong Xue.
