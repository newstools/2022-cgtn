China will improve the mechanism and expand the scope of infrastructure real-estate investment trusts (REITs) as part of efforts to better support the real economy, the country's securities regulator said on Friday. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) is guiding exchanges to develop rules for REITs expansion and will seek market comments in due course, according to a statement on the CSRC website. Meanwhile, the CSRC with other government departments are studying a pilot scheme for REITs based on subsidized rental housing and are looking to implement the scheme as soon as possible, the statement said. China's long-expected REITs pilot was initiated in June 2021 when the first batch of nine infrastructure projects began trading in exchanges in Shanghai and Shenzhen. There are currently 11 such trusts trading on the market.
