China on Thursday urged the U.S. to stop suppressing Chinese enterprises a day after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) revoked the authorization for two Chinese telecom companies, Pacific Networks and its wholly-owned subsidiary ComNet, to provide telecommunications services in the country. The primary business of the companies in the U.S. is selling retail calling cards. Previously, the FCC had revoked China Unicom's authorization to operate in the U.S. in January after it imposed a similar ban on China Telecom Americas last year. The FCC has breached the international economic and trade rules by making the move without listing any specific facts of the alleged violation, thereby damaging the legitimate rights and interests of consumers around the world, including the ones in the U.S., Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Thursday at a regular press conference. Zhao called the move "a generalization of the concept of national security" and "abuse of state power to unreasonably suppress Chinese companies." At a separate press conference on the same day, Chinese Commerce Ministry spokesperson Gao Feng said China firmly opposes the U.S. generalizing the "national security" concept and cracking down on Chinese companies without factual justification. He urged the U.S. to create a fair and stable market environment for firms of all countries. China would take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its enterprises, he warned.
