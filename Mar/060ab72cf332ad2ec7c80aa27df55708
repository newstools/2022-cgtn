Sri Lankan Power Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi said on Thursday that power cuts could continue into May, as many parts of the crisis-hit country currently face up to 13 hours without electricity due to a shortage of foreign currency to import fuel. Wanniarachchi mentioned that a diesel shipment under a $500 million credit line from India is expected to arrive on Saturday. "Once that arrives, we will be able to reduce load-shedding hours, but until we receive rains, probably sometime in May, power cuts will have to continue. There is nothing else we can do," the minister added.
