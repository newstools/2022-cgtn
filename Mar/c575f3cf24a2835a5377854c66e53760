Chinese lawmakers from an inspection team under the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee held a meeting Wednesday to hear a report on the enforcement of the country's environmental protection law. Li Zhanshu, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the meeting. China's legislation on ecological and environmental protection has made progress in quantity and quality, contributing to the fight against pollution, Li said. Underlining the environmental protection law as fundamental and comprehensive legislation that plays a leading role in ecological and environmental protection, Li said that problems discovered during the inspection should be solved under supervision. Li led the inspection with four teams sent to eight provincial-level regions. Other regions were inspected by standing committees of people's congresses at the provincial level.
