China does not intend to make geopolitical gains nor fill a "power vacuum," Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said when asked about China-Middle East relations. Wang said China has always played a constructive role in the Middle East and follows an approach of "double support," including solving regional security issues through unity, coordination and firmly supporting people in the region to explore their own development paths independently. He made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of the fifth session of the 13th National People's Congress on Monday. The power to protect security and development in the Middle East must be returned fully to the people in this region, Wang stressed.
