The death toll has risen to six after a car hit a carnival crowd in Strepy-Bracquegnies, a district of the former industrial town of Belgium's La Louviere on Sunday morning, local authorities said. The incident has also left several other injured, including 12 in critical condition. "At this stage, there are no elements to suggest that the attack had a terrorist motive," prosecutor Damien Verheyen told a news conference. According to early media report, the driver of the vehicle and other people in the car were detained and an investigation is opened.
