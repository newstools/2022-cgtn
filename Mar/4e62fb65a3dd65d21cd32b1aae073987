China on Thursday urged the U.S. to remove all the additional tariffs imposed on China's goods and put Sino-U.S. bilateral trade and economic ties back on the right track. Shu Jueting, the spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, made the remarks after the U.S. said on Wednesday that it had reinstated 352 expired product exclusions from U.S. "Section 301" tariffs on Chinese imports, well short of the 549 exclusions it was previously considering.
