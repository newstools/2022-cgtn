CGTN correspondent Dmitriy Maslak was reached by a local woman while reporting in Volnovakha, Ukraine. The woman asked Maslak to help find her daughter, who'd left the city and the city's communications with the outside world have been broken. For her daughter, the two weeks losing contact with her parents were the longest and scariest time. Maslak brings us their stories in their own words.
