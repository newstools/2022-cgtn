Israel said it will host a "historic" two-day summit from Sunday with top diplomats from the United States, United Arab Emirates (UAE), Bahrain and Morocco, according to its foreign ministry. The talks are intended to revive a nuclear deal with Iran that remains in limbo, Foreign Minister of Israel Yair Lapid said on Friday. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the foreign ministers of the UAE, Bahrain and Morocco will arrive in Israel for a series of diplomatic meetings on Sunday and Monday, Lapid said in a statement. Bahrain has joined the UAE in agreeing to normalize relations with Israel in 2020 under a U.S.-brokered deal known as the Abraham Accords, creating a new regional dynamic based on mutual concern over Iran. Morocco followed suit last year and the two countries signed a memorandum of understanding on military cooperation on Friday, the Israeli army's Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on Twitter. The leaders of Egypt, Israel and the UAE met in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh on Tuesday for talks on the economic impact of Ukraine crisis and Iran's influence at a time of uncertainty over Washington's security commitment in the region. Israel and Egypt signed a peace treaty in 1979. (With input from agencies)
