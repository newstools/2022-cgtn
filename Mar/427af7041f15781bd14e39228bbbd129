Mola Mountain to the south of the Kunlun Mountains that run through the western regions of China is dotted with a variety of landscapes, like the alpine wetlands on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Yarlung and Jinsha rivers carve through the terrain. In low-lying areas, the rivers created multiple highland lakes and wetlands. About 'Journeys in Nature': Sanjiangyuan series In the Sanjiangyuan Series, we present stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife of the Sanjiangyuan Region, where the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers originate. Sanjiangyuan has earned the title "Water tower of China" because its abundant glacier resources have a freshwater reserve of 200 billion cubic meters. The reservoir has nurtured abundant wild flora and fauna such as snow leopards, Himalayan blue sheep, Thorold's deer, Tibetan wild asses, and vultures.
