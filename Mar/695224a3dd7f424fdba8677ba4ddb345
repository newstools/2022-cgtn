A Tokyo court handed a six-month suspended jail sentence on Thursday to Greg Kelly, a former aide to ex-Nissan Motor CEO Carlos Ghosn, on financial misconduct charges. Prosecutors had sought a two-year sentence for Kelly, an American citizen who was detained alongside Ghosn in November 2018. The sentence will be suspended for three years, the judge said Thursday.
