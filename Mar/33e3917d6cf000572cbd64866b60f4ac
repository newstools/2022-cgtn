China-Russia cooperation has no limits, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular press briefing on Wednesday. He said no limits exist in striving for peace, safeguarding security and opposing hegemony. China and Russia are not allies, Wang said, but added that their relationship is neither confrontational nor targeted at third parties.
