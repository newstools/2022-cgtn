Tropical cyclone Gombe has killed at least 53 people since it hit Mozambique a week ago, authorities said on Thursday, in a sharp rise from earlier estimates. About 80 others have been injured and 400,000 affected since the cyclone swept into the northern and central areas of the country, flooding towns and destroying houses, figures showed.
