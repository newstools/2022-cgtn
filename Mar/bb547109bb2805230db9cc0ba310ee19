In November, the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau bids farewell to green. The distant mountaintops are gradually covered with snow. In the alpine shrubs, a herd of Thorold's deer have gathered. They are about to migrate elsewhere. About 'Journeys in Nature: Sanjiangyuan series' In the Sanjiangyuan series, we explore the stunning landscapes and abundant wildlife of the Sanjiangyuan Region, where the Yangtze, Yellow and Lancang rivers originate. Sanjiangyuan has earned the title "Water tower of China" because its abundant glacier resources have a freshwater reserve of 200 billion cubic meters. The reservoir has nurtured abundant wild flora and fauna such as snow leopards, Himalayan blue sheep, Thorold's deer, Tibetan wild asses and vultures.
