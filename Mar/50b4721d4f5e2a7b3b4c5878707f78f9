Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday said that China "deeply regrets that the Ukraine military conflict is still ongoing" and reiterated China's commitment for "a door to peace." Wang made the remarks during a virtual meeting with Josep Borrell, the European Union (EU)'s high representative for foreign affairs and security policy. China in its own way has been pushing for the cooldown of the situation and hoping to achieve peace at an early date, Wang noted, urging a ceasefire and peace talks. Borrell also called for an immediate ceasefire, adding that the ongoing war in Ukraine has severely affected the EU and the world. The EU representative also called for the establishment of humanitarian corridors, the prevention of Russia evading relevant sanctions, and urged that weapons of mass destruction not be used. He said he hopes China will play an important role in pushing the realization of peace in the area.
