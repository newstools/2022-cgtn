With over 10,000 confirmed cases reported, Jilin Province is now at the center of the latest COVID-19 outbreak in the Chinese mainland. The province is getting a helping hand from other provinces with hundreds of people arriving in the past few days to help with medical treatment, PCR testing and transferring patients. The local railway bureau in the neighboring city of Shenyang has opened an express logistics channel to Changchun, the capital city of Jilin Province. Over 1,000 units of epidemic prevention supplies and five tons of food and vegetables have been delivered to Changchun. The governor of Jilin Province has pledged that the outbreak would be contained within a week by imposing measures of full-scale PCR testing, full admission of confirmed cases and full centralized isolation of close contacts.
