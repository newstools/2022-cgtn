Smaller than the European robin, a red-flanked bluetail, or the orange-flanked bush-robin, was photographed enjoying early spring in Beijing's Yuyuantan Park. It flew from one bush to another, often landing on the ground for a quick bite – it loves insects. Both males and females have a blue tail and orange-red flanks. Adult males have dark blue feathers covering head and back, while females and adolescents have olive brown upper parts.
