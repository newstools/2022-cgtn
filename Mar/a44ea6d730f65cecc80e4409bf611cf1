Ukraine and Russia will continue their peace talks on Wednesday, Ukrainian Presidential Advisor Mykhailo Podolyak, also a member of the delegation, said Tuesday. "We'll continue tomorrow. A very difficult and viscous negotiation process. There are fundamental contradictions. But there is certainly room for compromise," Podolyak tweeted. The work in subgroups will continue during the break, he added. The fourth round of negotiations started on Monday via video link and continued into Tuesday. Sharing the outlook of the ongoing peace talks on Wednesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the talks were sounding more realistic but more time was needed. "The meetings continue, and, I am informed, the positions during the negotiations already sound more realistic. But time is still needed for the decisions to be in the interests of Ukraine," he said in a video address ahead of the resumption of the talks. In a hint of a possible compromise, Zelenskyy said earlier Ukraine was prepared to accept security guarantees from the West that stop short of its long-term goal of joining the NATO. Moscow sees any future Ukraine membership of the Western military alliance as a threat and has demanded guarantees it will never join. (With input from agencies)
