Top Chinese medical expert Zhang Boli on Saturday suggested preserving the country's "valuable experience" in COVID-19 prevention and control at the legal and institutional levels during his attendance of China's annual political meetings, known as the "Two Sessions." As a deputy to China's top legislature, the National People's Congress (NPC), 74-year-old Zhang said in an interview with CGTN that China should take its experience fighting COVID-19 to the "institutional level" to deal with the virus "more actively in the future." Zhang is an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering and head of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. He was given the national honorary title "the People's Hero" in 2020 for his contribution to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
