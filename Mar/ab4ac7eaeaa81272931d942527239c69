CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia, the news channel said on Friday after the introduction of a new law there that could jail anyone intentionally spreading "fake" news. Russia's parliament on Friday passed a law imposing a jail term of up to 15 years for spreading intentionally "fake" news about the military, stepping up the information war over the conflict in Ukraine. "If the fakes lead to serious consequences, then imprisonment of up to 15 years threatens," the lower house of parliament, known as the Duma in Russian, said in a statement. People calling for sanctions against Russia following the conflicts with Ukraine will also be imposed fines, according to the new law, which was approved by Russia's upper house of parliament and signed into law by Putin. False information has been spread by Russia's enemies, including the United States and its Western European allies, in an attempt to sow discord among the Russian people, Russian officials said. "CNN will stop broadcasting in Russia while we continue to evaluate the situation and our next steps moving forward," a spokesperson said. News organizations, including the BBC and Canadian Broadcasting Corp, have also suspended reporting from Russia following the passing of the law. Facebook and Twitter have been blocked for restricting Russian state-backed channels. Websites of Deutsche Welle and Voice of America were also blocked for what it said was "false information about the war in Ukraine," according to the TASS news agency. (With input from agencies)
