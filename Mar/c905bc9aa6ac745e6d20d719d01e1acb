Team China announced on Sunday that Yang Hongqiong will be the flag bearer for the closing ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Paralympic Games. Yang, 32, clinched three gold medals – in Para cross-country skiing women's long distance sitting, middle distance sitting and sprint sitting – at the Beijing Games. She also became the first Chinese Para skier to collect three gold medals at a single Paralympics. The champion skier from southwest China's Yunnan Province had been a wheelchair basketball player before switching to Para cross-country skiing in 2018. Being a flag bearer is an honor that comes with a great responsibility for Yang. "I will try my best to get the job done perfectly, and demonstrate the vigorous, positive characters of Chinese Paralympians," she said. The 2022 Winter Paralympics will conclude with the closing ceremony at 8 p.m. BJT at the National Stadium in Beijing. Stay tuned!
