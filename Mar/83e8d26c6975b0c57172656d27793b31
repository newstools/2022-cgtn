Three ships carrying nearly 300 ready-to-assemble cabins arrived in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on Tuesday, a day after departing from south China's Guangdong Province. Officials say they will be turned into isolation wards at temporary hospitals in the HKSAR. Over the last two weeks, 5,000 of such modules have been sent out from the Zhongshan Huangpu Port in neighboring Guangdong Province. Those shipments have helped complete a 3,900-bed makeshift hospital in Tsing Yi, where COVID-19 patients with mild or no symptoms are being treated. There are plans to set up 10,000 more cabins for three other sites under construction across the HKSAR.
