Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) envoys met with Myanmar's State Administration Council (SAC) Chairman Senior General Min Aung Hlaing on Monday in the latest efforts after the military takeover of the Asian country. They discussed "the situation of protests and violence stemming from political disagreement" and humanitarian cooperation, said the council's Information Team in a statement. Cambodian Deputy Prime Minister Prak Sokhonn, ASEAN's current special envoy, and Lim Jock Hoi, secretary-general of ASEAN, attended the talks in Nay Pyi Taw. Min Aung Hlaing apprised the ASEAN envoys of the results of the 2020 general elections and the situation of terrorist actions in Myanmar, the release said.
