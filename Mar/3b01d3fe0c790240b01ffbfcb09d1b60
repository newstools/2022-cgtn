The Tianzhou-2 cargo spacecraft completed all tasks of space station assembly and separated from the space station core module at 3:59 p.m. Beijing time on Sunday, according to the China Manned Space Engineering Office. Tianzhou-2 is the first cargo spacecraft sent into orbit in the key technology verification phase of China's space station. During its operation in orbit, Tianzhou-2 carried out a series of extended application tests. The spacecraft is in good condition, and will re-enter the Earth's atmosphere at an appropriate time under ground control. "Tianzhou-2 will fully disintegrate and burn up when entering the atmosphere, making no impact on the infrastructure and ships in the sea," said Zou Xuemei, cargo spacecraft mission chief at the Beijing Aerospace Control Center. Carrying 6.8 tonnes of supplies for the space station, Tianzhou-2 was launched from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site on the coast of the southern island province of Hainan on May 29, 2021.
