Large flocks of migratory birds, including some endangered species, have been spotted migrating and landing in wetlands and seashore areas across China. Dozens of great egrets were seen resting in a mudflat at the Huangshui National Wetland Park in Xining, the provincial capital of northwest China's Qinghai Province. The long-necked, snow-white winged bird is under second-grade protection in China. A local bird watcher said the number of great egrets spotted in the area has been rising in recent years. Far on the east, locals have flocked to the coastal harbor of Yantai City, Shandong Province, to enjoy the thrilling spring scenery as flocks of seagulls swoop and circle in the sky. Every spring, some 40,000 to 50,000 seagulls are seen hovering around the area. Meanwhile, a flock of 30 or so white swans was spotted swimming in a city wetland park in Funing County, east China's Jiangsu Province. Local authorities have been working to improve the ecology of the wetland, which has become a popular resting spot for migratory birds. (Cover image via screenshot.)
