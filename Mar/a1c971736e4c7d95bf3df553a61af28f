In his third season in the NBA, 22-year-old Ja Morant has led the Memphis Grizzlies to No. 2 in the Western Conference, over the Golden State Warriors, Utah Jazz, Denver Nuggets and Dallas Mavericks. With remarkable athleticism, Morant can easily make new posters by charging the rim or completing extreme double pumps. However, as a born orchestrator, Morant knows how to run the game in a reasonable way, and many of his moves look like work by crafty 30+years-old veterans.
