Around 200 people were injured, some of them critically, after a makeshift spectators stand for a football match collapsed at a school in the southern Indian state of Kerala, officials said Sunday. A part of the stand collapsed Saturday night at Kalikavu's Poongod in Malappuram district, about 378 km north of Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala. According to officials, overcrowding was what caused the makeshift stand to collapse, minutes before the game began.
