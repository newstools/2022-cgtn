Retired firefighter Lam Sau-keung from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has become an "anti-pandemic" volunteer. He also helps recruit other retired firemen, adding nearly 600 to the volunteers list. As experienced firemen, Lam and his colleagues are accustomed to dangerous conditions. However, the risk of infection during the COVID-19 pandemic is still a cause for fear. But Lam feels the need for volunteers has become greater than ever before. He insists on overcoming his fears and keeps encouraging others to join in the fight against the pandemic. Apart from retired firefighters, the Hong Kong Fire Services Department is now fully staffed to serve the public, including cadets in training involved in logistical work.
