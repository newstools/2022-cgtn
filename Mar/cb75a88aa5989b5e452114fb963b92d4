Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro confirmed on Monday that he had a two-hour meeting with a U.S. delegation on Saturday, according to Reuters. "Last Saturday night a delegation from the government of the United States of America arrived in Venezuela. I received it here at the presidential palace," Maduro said in a broadcast on state media. Officials from the two countries discussed easing oil sanctions imposed on Venezuela, but made little progress towards reaching a deal, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Sunday.
