An Asiatic golden cat was seen in a video feeding on a tufted deer recently at the Laohegou Conservation Center of the Giant Panda National Park in Mianyang City, southwest China's Sichuan Province. It is the first high-definition footage of the wild cat feeding in China. The Asiatic golden cat, which is under first-class state protection in China, is primarily found in forested areas, particularly tropical and subtropical moist evergreen forests, mixed evergreen forests, and dry deciduous forests. It remains one of the least understood cats because it gets so little notice. Historically, it was widely distributed in the mountains and forests of south and southwest China. However, due to the loss of forest habitat and human hunting, its population has experienced a continuous and serious decline.
