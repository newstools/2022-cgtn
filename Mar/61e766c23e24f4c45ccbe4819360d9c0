The sudden snow that hit most of the area of south China is finally gone, and the spring takes the stage with its vibrant colors. In southwest China's Yunnan Province, the rapeseed flowers have turned to an endless ocean carpeting Luoping County. The yellow and green fields wave into each other, which looks like a crayon drawing from afar. The Jiulong Waterfall sits on the north part of the county, and it has been listed as one of the top six most beautiful waterfalls in China by Chinese National Geography for its special geological structure. Guided by the Chinese lunisolar calendar, the local Buyi ethnic people gather near the waterfall on February 2 and March 3 every year, to celebrate the Song Festival and Water Splashing Festival.
