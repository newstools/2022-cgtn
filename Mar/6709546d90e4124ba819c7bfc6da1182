Lawmakers in Argentina on Friday approved a deal with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to restructure a staggering $45 billion debt ahead of a vote in the upper house, a parliament official said. With 200 votes in favor, 37 against and 15 abstentions, the package obtained "an affirmative result and will be communicated to the honorable Senate," chamber president Sergio Massa stated.
