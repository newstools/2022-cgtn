China has successfully completed this year's first test run of a high-thrust oxyhydrogen engine, which is designed for the country's new generation carrier rocket Long March-5, according to its developer. The test further verified the reliability of the engine, which is the most advanced cryogenic liquid rocket engine that has been put into use in China, according to the 6th Academy of the China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC). The test lasted 520 seconds. It will go through more than 20 experimental tasks to further test its reliability. The engine is designed for the core stage of the Long March-5 series carrier rocket, which will be used to launch the two lab modules of China's space station later this year.
