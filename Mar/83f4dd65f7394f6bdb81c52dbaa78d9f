The Dallas Cowboys agreed to trade their ace wide receiver (WR) Amari Cooper to the Cleveland Browns for a fifth-round and a sixth-round draft pick for 2022, according to a report by ESPN's Adam Schefter. Cooper will need to pass a physical before the deal can be finalized in the middle of next week. The Browns need to fix their weakness in the WR position after ranking 28th in passing attempts (520) and 27th in passing yards (3,320), in the league. They had no one achieve more than 600 receiving yards. Only Jarvis Landry competed over 35 receptions. The Browns had really high expectations on Odell Beckham Jr. but decided to waive him last November. Then Beckham joined the Los Angeles Rams and won the title in Super Bowl LV while the Browns failed to make the playoffs with a 8-9 record. Cooper is likely to provide enough support to quarterback Baker Mayfield. Cooper was targeted 104 times, completed 68 receptions for 865 yards and eight touchdowns last season paring with Dak Prescott in the Cowboys. However, Cooper's performance actually fell compared with the 1,114-receiving-yard season in 2020 when he signed the five-year, $100-million contract extension. The Cowboys were trying to trade him away before his 2021 base salary of $20 million turns fully guaranteed on March 20. CeeDee Lamb is likely to fill in the role of Cooper after the trade. The third-year WR led the Cowboys in both receptions (79) and receiving yards (1,102) last season. He was named for Pro Bowl for the first time in 2021. Another WR Michael Gallup may sign a long-term deal with the Cowboys, according to ESPN. Though he suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee at the end of the season, Gallup had 1,107 receiving yards in 2019, which gives the team confidence in him.
