The United States on Tuesday announced an agreement with Britain to end tariffs on steel and aluminum imports imposed by former President Donald Trump. "By allowing for a flow of duty-free steel and aluminum from the UK, we further ease the gap between supply and demand for these products in the United States," Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in a statement.
