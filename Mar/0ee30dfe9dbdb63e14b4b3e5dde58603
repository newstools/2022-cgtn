Photographer Lin Ge captured these lovely images of a grey-headed woodpecker in snow in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The grey-headed woodpecker prefers deciduous forests and feeds on insects in summer and plant seeds in winter. They are often seen alone or in pairs, but rarely in groups.
