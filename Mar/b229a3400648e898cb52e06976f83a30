Officials from the International Paralympic Committee (IPC) visited the National Indoor Stadium in Beijing and spoke highly of the preparations. From barrier-free facilities, to technical support and transportation services, nearly 10 officials from the IPC checked the conversion. This is the group's second visit following their first tour three days before, when they offered suggestions on things to be improved. Patrick Stolpmann, head of Technology and Transformation of the IPC, said the facilities meet the demands, and expressed his gratitude to the Chinese team responsible for the conversion. The IPC's Games Brand Manager Gisella Duarte said she was impressed by the changes made in urban landscaping, including the mascot Shuey Rhon Rhon.
