The Chinese Foreign Ministry slammed the United States on Monday for spreading disinformation about China amid the conflict in Ukraine. Spokesperson Zhao Lijian offered the response when asked about recent remarks by U.S. officials who claimed that Russia has requested military equipment from China. "The most urgent task right now is to exercise restraint and deescalate the tense situation in Ukraine, rather than adding fuel to the fire," Zhao told a regular press briefing.
