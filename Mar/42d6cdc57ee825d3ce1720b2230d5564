China's National Energy Administration has released a guideline on energy development for 2022, detailing targets for securing energy supplies and boosting energy efficiency. In 2022, annual domestic energy production capacity will amount to 4.41 billion tonnes of standard coal, while crude oil output will reach around 200 million tonnes, according to the guideline. Natural gas output is expected to reach 214 billion cubic meters, the guideline specified. Last year, the country's total natural gas output reached 205.3 billion cubic meters, according to the administration, increasing by 8.2 percent year on year. It also seeks to steadily lower the nation's dependence on coal, pledging to increase the share of non-fossil fuels in China's overall energy consumption to around 17.3 percent. Wind power and photovoltaic power generation will account for about 12.2 percent of power consumption, the guideline noted. (With input from Xinhua)
