Daniel Riolo's recent report about Neymar attending Paris Saint-Germain's team practice drunk again has drawn a lot of questions about the Brazilian striker's professionalism. It's Neymar's fifth season with PSG in what was the world's most expensive transfer at 222 million euros (about $243.9 million), but his most valuable honors were all achieved with Barcelona. Moreover, Neymar's stats continue to drop yearly, even as PSG searches for other star players to support him. In an age when superstars can maintain their form longer with the help of a scientific diet and training, Neymar, at 30, is declining early and fast. What's next for him and PSG?
