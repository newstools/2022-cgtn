The Tianzhou-3, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies to the China Space Station, fully separated from China's space station core module Tianhe on Sunday at 10:59 (BJT), after completing all assigned space station assembly tasks, according to the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO). China successfully launched the Tianzhou-3 on September, 20, 2021 from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province, carrying about six tonnes of goods to the China Space Station. On April 20, 2022, the cargo spacecraft docked with Tianhe's front docking port. At present, the Tianzhou-3 cargo spacecraft is in good condition and will re-enter the atmosphere under ground control in the future, also said the CMSEO. China Space Station Mission 2022 A total of six space flight missions will be carried out in 2022 to complete the in-orbit construction of China Space Station. So far, a Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft has been launched in May. The Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft has also been launched in June with three astronauts in the core module stationing in orbit for six months. Next step, the Wentian lab module will dock with the Tianhe core module in July, and the Mengtian lab module will be docked with the core module in October to complete the in-orbit construction of China Space Station. The Tianzhou-5 cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-15 manned spacecraft will then follow, taking another three astronauts to stay in orbit for six months. Ultimately, a T-shaped complex will then be formed once the construction of the space station is completed. In addition, the country also plans to launch its first large Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST), or Xuntian, meaning "survey to heavens" in English, in 2022.
