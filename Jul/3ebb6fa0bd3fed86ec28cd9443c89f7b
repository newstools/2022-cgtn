France will face Germany in the semifinals of Women's Euro 2022 after ending the Netherlands' reign as European champions thanks to Eve Perisset's penalty in a 1-0 win after extra-time on Saturday. France were frustrated for 90 minutes by the brilliance of young Dutch goalkeeper Daphne van Domselaar. However, the FC Twente stopper was finally beaten from the penalty spot 12 minutes into extra-time when French forward Kadidiatou Diani was fouled by Dutch defender Dominique Janssen. It took a video assistant referee (VAR) review for the spot-kick to be awarded and Perisset's penalty just had too much power for Van Domselaar. Defeat rounded off a difficult tournament for the Dutch, who had been weakened by injuries to key players and coronavirus cases. "I'm very proud because this team aimed at a big target, this team gives absolutely everything. I like the fact that the players gave it their all and kept plugging away. They stayed true to our game plan; all the players performed their roles and we saw how well that worked. The players that came on certainly did not weaken the side, quite the contrary," said coach Corinne Diacre of France. Selma Bacha of France was awarded with the Player of the Match prize. "She changed the intensity of France's attack with roaming movement inside, wide combinations and defensive tenacity," concluded the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Technical Observer panel.
