Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is due to leave the Maldives for Singapore on a private jet that landed in the capital Male on Thursday, the local Daily Mirror reported. Rajapaksa, along with his wife Ioma and two security officials, was expected to take a Singapore Airlines flight last night, but that didn't happen because of security concerns, the paper said.
