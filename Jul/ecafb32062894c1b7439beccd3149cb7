CGTN's "A Decade of Change" series recounts the remarkable changes in Chinese provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions over the past 10 years. This episode features central China's Hubei Province, with its many bridges, each of which is a business card for high-quality development. During the past decade, 21 new bridges over the Yangtze River have been erected in Hubei, which also has made significant progress in high-tech industrial and economic development.
