The U.S. Supreme Court has dealt a major blow to the Environmental Protection Agency's power to regulate carbon emissions that cause climate change. The United Nations has called the ruling "a setback in our fight against climate change." Wu Changhua, vice chair of the governing council of the Asia Pacific Water Forum, said that the climate fight is a global issue, and the Supreme Court's ruling will eventually harm all lives on the planet.
