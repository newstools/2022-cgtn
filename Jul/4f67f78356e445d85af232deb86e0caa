The Phoenix Suns and their starting center, Deandre Ayton, put an end to their yearlong contract extension soap opera after the franchise decided to match the four-year, $133 million deal offered to Ayton by the Indiana Pacers. The Suns managed to save money because they avoided giving Ayton a five-year, $173 million contract. However, they will have to deal with his frustration at least for the first few months of the 2022-23 season. Ayton will still be paid a lot of money for only four years, instead of the usual five. He will also hit the free agency market earlier than others in his class. If he can remain healthy and continue improving like he has been, Ayton will still have a good chance to ink another lucrative contract in four years. Therefore, it will be in the common interest of both the team and player for Ayton to perform well on the court and for the Suns to help him do so.
