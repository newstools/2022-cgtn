Exports of China's photovoltaic products surged 113.1 percent year-on-year in the first half of 2022, according to data released by the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology on Wednesday. The total export value of photovoltaic products doubled to 25.9 billion yuan ($3.83 billion) in the first six months, official data showed. Total solar power capacity now stands at 340 GW, up 25.8 percent compared to the same period of last year, Wang Bohua, the honorary chairman of the China Photovoltaic Industry Association (CPIA), said at a forum on Thursday. The newly installed PV capacity in China is expected to stand at between 85 GW and 100 GW this year, Wang said. That is 10 GW higher than his previous prediction. To support the goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2060, China aims to increase non-fossil energy consumption to more than 80 percent of its total mix by 2060, and its solar and wind generation capacity to reach 1,200 GW by 2030.
