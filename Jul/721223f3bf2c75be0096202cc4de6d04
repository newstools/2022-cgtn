About cholera Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by ingestion of food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholera, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Cholera can cause severe acute watery diarrhea. It takes 12 hours-five days for a person to show symptoms after ingesting contaminated food or water. Most people infected with Vibrio cholera do not develop any symptoms, although the bacteria are present in their feces for 1-10 days after infection and are shed back into the environment, potentially infecting other people, said the WHO. Cholera is an easily treatable disease. The majority of people can be treated successfully through prompt administration of oral rehydration solution. A multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera, and reducing deaths. A combination of surveillance, water, sanitation and hygiene, social mobilization, treatment and oral cholera vaccines are used.
