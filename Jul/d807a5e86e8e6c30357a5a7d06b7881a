"To be aware is to be alive" is one of the signages along the halls of the Dangerous Drug Abuse Treatment and Rehabilitation Center (DDATRC) in Sarangani Province, the Philippines. The drug rehabilitation center was constructed by the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) in 2018. The project was built and funded by China to support then President Rodrigo Duterte's campaign against illegal drugs that plagued the Philippine society for decades. The project employed 450 skilled workers, providing them with job opportunities and technical training as they learned advanced construction methods.
