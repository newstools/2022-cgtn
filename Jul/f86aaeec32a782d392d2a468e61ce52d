The residents of the Park Road Affordable Housing Community are roused from sleep by the singing of chirping birds in the early morning. In the soft morning light, several new orange and grey high-rise residential buildings stand tall and distinct from a distance. After breakfast with his family, Kamau drives his child to school to start the beautiful day. "Having a comfortable house is the dream of many Kenyans. Now my dream has come true. Everything is getting better," he said. The new house and its surroundings start a fresh life. With the realization of the "Affordable Housing Dream," Kamau has an unlimited vision for future.
