At least two people were killed and more than 15 others wounded in a suicide car bombing at a popular hotel in the south-central Somali town of Jowhar, capital city of Hirshabelle state, Sunday, a government official confirmed. Daud Haji Irro, a spokesman for Hirshabelle, said the death toll could rise after attackers rammed a car laden with explosives into Nuur Doob Hotel, which is frequented by regional government officials. The regional government official said two ministers and a lawmaker from Hirshabelle are those wounded in the attack. Al-Shabab claimed responsibility for the latest attack, saying it has targeted a hotel housing Hirshabelle regional officials. (With input from Xinhua)
