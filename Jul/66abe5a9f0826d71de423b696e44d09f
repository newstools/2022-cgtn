"The detention of migrants, I think, is an example that there are entanglements that have to do with the law, entanglements that have to do with politics, and frankly, that don't make a lot of sense. And all of that results from the fact that we are living with a set of laws that hasn't been reformed in decades, is outdated and inadequate for the challenges that we face at our border. And there are human beings paying the price for that, for our failure to fix our policies," said Cecilia Munoz, senior advisor of New America, former director of the Domestic Policy Council of the United States.
