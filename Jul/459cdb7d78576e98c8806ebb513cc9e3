Team China advanced to the last eight in all five events at the Malaysia Masters, including the women's and men's singles, women's and mens doubles, and mixed doubles. In the eight victories for Chinese shuttlers on Thursday, Chen Yufei is the only one left in the women's singles contention, while Liang Weikeng and Wang Chang are the only men's pair to enter the quarterfinals. Lu Guangzu and compatriot Li Shifeng will set up an all-Chinese quarterfinal round tomorrow in the men's singles event, while four Chinese duos proceeded to the next round of women's doubles and mixed doubles events. Olympic silver medalists Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan will play with compatriots Du Yue and Li Wenmei in Friday's women's doubles quarterfinal match. Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, also runners-up at the Tokyo Olympics, clinched their 27th straight victory in the mixed doubles event this season on Thursday, and are en route to their sixth straight title.
