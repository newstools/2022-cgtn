China maintained their perfect diving record at the 2022 International swimming federation (FINA) World Championships and clinched two gold medals at the Duna Arena in Budapest on Thursday. Fresh from their overwhelming victories that produced three golds in just four hours, Chinese divers showed no signs of slowing down. Chen Yuxi and Quan Hongchan, who bagged gold and silver respectively in the individual 10m platform event earlier this week, teamed up to come out on top in the women's 10m synchro platform final. The flawless Chinese pair barely made a splash and led the pack from start to finish before securing the world title with a whopping 368.40 points. American duo Delaney Schnell and Katrina Young finished a distant second with 299.40, while Padelela Pamg and Nur Dhabitah Sabri of Malaysia completed the podium with 298.68. The result means China have won this event the last 11 times it has been competed at the world championships. The powerhouses' dominance continued in the men's 1m springboard final later in the day as Olympic champion Wang Zongyuan once again reminded the world of his diving prowess. The Hubei-born child prodigy became the youngest gold medal winner in this event at the tender age of 17 at the 2019 FINA World Championships in South Korea. Three years later, he managed to score 493.30 points and defended his title with effortless ease, outclassing Britain's Jack Laugher (426.95) and Australia's Li Shixin (395.40) in a one-sided affair. It was Wang's third gold in Budapest. He has already pocketed an individual gold in the men's 3m springboard before partnering up with Cao Yuan to emerge triumphant in the men's 3m synchro final.
