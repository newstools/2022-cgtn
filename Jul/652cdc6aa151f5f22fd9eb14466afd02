A four-day joint maritime exercise between China and Pakistan kicked off at a military port in Shanghai on Sunday. The drill, codenamed Sea Guardians-2, is a normal arrangement as per a yearly plan between the two militaries, said Liu Wensheng, spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army Navy. It is not related to any regional situations and does not target any third party, Liu said. The joint exercise aims to enhance defense cooperation, exchange expertise and experience, deepen the traditional friendship between the two countries and militaries, and promote the development of China-Pakistan all-weather strategic cooperative partnership, said the spokesperson. This is the second time China and Pakistan have conducted joint naval exercise codenamed Sea Guardians. The first was held in January 2020 in the North Arabian Sea. (With input from Xinhua)
