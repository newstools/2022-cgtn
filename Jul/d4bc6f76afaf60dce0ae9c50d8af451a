Twitter sued Elon Musk on Tuesday for breaching the $44 billion contract he signed to buy the tech firm, calling his exit strategy "a model of hypocrisy," court documents showed. The suit filed in the U.S. state of Delaware urges the court to order the billionaire to complete the agreed deal to buy Twitter, arguing that no financial damages could repair the damage that he has caused.
