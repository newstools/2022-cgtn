Team China bagged two gold medals during the Malaysia Masters badminton tournament in Kuala Lumpur on Sunday. Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong defeated Indonesia's Rinov Rivaldy and Pitha Haningtyas Mentari 21-17, 21-12 in the mixed doubles final to claim their sixth title in a row. It is also the 30th consecutive victory for the world's No. 1 pair. "I'm so happy to take another gold in Malaysia. It's been very tiring, but we have managed to keep on fighting," Zheng said. "I love the number six, and it's the luck from my baby," he said, posting a photo of his newborn son on social media recently. In the women's doubles final, Chinese pair Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan had a convincing 21-11, 21-12 victory over Japanese duo Nami Matsuyama and Chiharu Shida for their fourth title this season, making up for a disappointing quarterfinal exit in the Malaysia Open last week. In the women's singles final, An Se-young put an end to her seven-match losing streak against China's Chen Yufei, stunning the Olympic champion 21-17, 21-5 in just 38 minutes. "I can't believe I won this. It's really surreal. I won't sleep tonight!" said the 20-year-old player from the Republic of Korea. "I lost many times to her. I learned a lot from our past matches and studied her videos. Instead of thinking about beating her, I was focused on improving myself. It was a battle over myself," she added. Indonesia's Chico Aura Dwi Wardoyo defeated Ng Ka Long Angus of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 22-20, 21-15 to claim the men's singles title. The badminton event ran from July 5 to 10 with $360,000 in prize money.
