Non-fossil fuel energy sources will make up more than half of China's total installed power capacity by 2025, according to a report released by the China Electricity Council (CEC) on Wednesday. By 2025, China's installed power capacity will reach 3 billion kilowatts, and non-fossil fuel energy sources such as wind, nuclear, solar and hydro-power will account for 51 percent of China's total power generation capacity, according to the report. By the end of 2021, China's full-caliber non-fossil energy power installed capacity stood at 1.11845 billion kilowatts, accounting for 47 percent of the national total capacity, 13.5 percentage points higher than the previous year. Coal-fired power plants up to the ultra-low emission standards have a total capacity of around 1.03 billion kilowatts, accounting for 93 percent of China's total coal-fired power generation capacity. The scale of China's electricity trade continues to expand. In 2021, a total of 3.7787 trillion kilowatt-hours of electricity were traded in the national market, accounting for 45.5 percent of the total electricity consumption of the whole society. "A unified electricity market system has gradually taken shape. From January to May this year, the entire volume of electricity traded at the market reached 2.0229 trillion kilowatt hours, accounting for 60.4 percent of the total, higher than that of last year. The role of market allocation will expand further," said Hao Yingjie, secretary general of the CEC. The report predicts that the total electricity consumption of the whole society throughout 2022 will grow by five to six percent. By 2025, the annual electricity consumption nationwide will reach 9.5 trillion kilowatt-hours for an average growth rate of 4.8 percent, said the report.
