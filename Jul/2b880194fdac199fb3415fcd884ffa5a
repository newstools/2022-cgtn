Angel Di Maria signed a one-year contract with Juventus on Friday. The Argentina winger joined the Serie A giants after reaching the end of his contract at Paris Saint-Germain. The Old Lady will be Di Maria's sixth club. He previously played for Rosario Central, Benfica, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain. Di Maria enjoyed a successful seven-year stint with PSG, where he won five French league championships and scored 92 goals in 295 games. The 34-year-old who won the La Liga and Champions League titles with Real Madrid is now set to experience life in Italy. He could have a big role to play on the wing from the start at Juventus, with Federico Chiesa still recovering from a torn ACL suffered in January. (With input from AP)
