The orbiter of China's Mars probe Tianwen-1 relayed high-definition footage of the red planet's natural satellite Phobos on Saturday, which marks the two-year anniversary of the launch of the mission. China launched the Tianwen-1 mission on July 23, 2020, sending an orbiter and a rover to the red planet. The orbiter entered the Mars orbit in February 2021, and the rover landed on Mars and started operations in May 2021. Mars has two small natural satellites, Phobos and Deimos (which mean fear and terror). Recently, the Tianwen-1 operation team seized the timing when the orbiter was relatively close to Phobos and captured clear images of the satellite in its "full moon" state.
