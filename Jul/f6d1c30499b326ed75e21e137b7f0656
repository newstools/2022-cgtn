As the first head of state China has hosted after the Beijing Olympic Winter Games, Indonesian President Joko Widodo's trip to China speaks volumes about the strong commitment of the two sides to growing their bilateral ties, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday. Wang made the remarks when talking with Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and Indonesian Coordinator for Cooperation with China and Coordinating Minister Luhut Binsar Pandjaitan. Wang hoped the two sides could further deepen high-quality Belt and Road cooperation and ensure the completion of the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway as scheduled and ensure good implementation of such major cooperation projects as the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and "the Two Countries, Twin Parks." China fully supports Indonesia in hosting the G20 Bali Summit and will give full support to Indonesia's ASEAN chairmanship next year, and will address current global challenges through consultation and cooperation, Wang said. China welcomes Indonesia's continued active participation in "BRICS Plus" cooperation, Wang added. For Indonesia's part, Luhut and Retno said they expect the country to make full use of the high-level talks and other mechanisms to actively promote implementation of cooperation projects, including the Jakarta-Bandung high-speed railway and "the Two Countries, Twin Parks," achieve mutual benefits and jointly promote world peace, development and prosperity. Indonesia is ready to join BRICS cooperation and make active efforts for the growth of ASEAN-China relations, Luhut and Retno added. The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue.
