In Germany, multiple women have reported feeling dizzy after attending a summer party hosted by the Social Democratic Party. AFP reports that at least nine women filed complaints, following an invite-only event attended by Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Members of Parliament. Local media reports say the women likely fell victim to date-rape drugs.
