Two fires broke out in southeast London as the UK faces ongoing dry conditions and braces for another heatwave. In the town of West Wickham, farmers used tractors to make a "fire break" to control a blaze that had broken out in a field, while firefighters used hoses and fire beaters to extinguish the flames. In Bexleyheath, six fire engines and 40 firefighters were sent to tackle a fire that broke out on a wooded patch of land in a residential area near several homes. No injuries have been reported so far.
