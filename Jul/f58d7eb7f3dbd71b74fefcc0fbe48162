The U.S. House of Representatives passed a pair of bills on Friday aimed at protecting access to abortion. The bills cleared the Democratic-led chamber largely along party lines, but are expected to fail in the Senate. The U.S. Supreme Court struck down the landmark Roe v. Wade ruling last month, eliminating the constitutional protection of abortion rights for women in the nation.
