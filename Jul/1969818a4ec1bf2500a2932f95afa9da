South Koreans protested in front of the Japanese Embassy in Seoul on Tuesday to condemn Japan's plan to discharge nuclear wastewater into the ocean. They said that the ocean is shared by all humans and does not belong exclusively to Japan and that the South Korean government should take a tougher stance to reject Japan's decision.
