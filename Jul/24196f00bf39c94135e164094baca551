Tottenham have completed the 60m British pound signing of Richarlison from Everton. The Brazil forward has signed a five-year deal at Spurs, moving to London after four years at Goodison Park. An Everton statement said: "Richarlison has completed a transfer from Everton to Tottenham Hotspur for an undisclosed fee." "Everyone at Everton would like to thank Richarlison for his service and commitment during his time with the Club." Richarlison, 25, scored 10 goals and assisted five times in 30 Premier League games for Everton last season, as the club narrowly avoided relegation with a 16th-placed finish. He scored 53 times in 152 appearances for the Merseyside club since joining in 2018 from Watford, who are due to receive 10 percent of any fee over 40m British pounds for the striker. Richarlison is Tottenham's fourth summer signing, following Fraser Forster, Ivan Perisic and Yves Bissouma to the north London club.
