Chinese volleyball star player Zhu Ting has joined Italian club Pallavolo Scandicci in the Serie A1. Both the team and the player herself confirmed the news on Saturday. Zhu will play for the team in the 2022-23 season. Zhu underwent surgery in April to fix a wrist injury and has been recovering in Europe since then. That's why she didn't join the Chinese women's national team for the ongoing FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League. "I'm glad to join Scandicci and can't wait to go back to the volleyball court," the 27-year-old said, according to China Media Group. She will be wearing the No. 4 jersey at the Italian club. Like the Turkish VakıfBank Sports Club that Zhu used to play for, Scandicci has been a traditional powerhouse in both Serie A1 and European competitions. The team's head coach Massimo Barbolini led Italy to win the championship of the FIVB Volleyball World Cup twice in 2007 and 2011. He has also coached multiple heavyweights and helped them win many titles. Zhu will join a group of excellent teammates including Ofelia Malinov, Elena Pietrini and Ekaterina Antropova in the Italian league. It has been months since Zhu played in a regular game. It may not be easy for her to catch up with teammates immediately in a strong team like Scandicci, but Zhu has what it takes to overcome the difficulties and find her best form back soon. Scandicci welcomed Zhu's arrival in a statement and called her "Zhuper" for her sharp offensive skills. With a competitive squad like this, coach Barbolini has some ambitious goals to achieve in the new season.
