Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday visited an ancient earthen city during his inspection tour in Turpan City of northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The Jiaohe Ruins can be dated back to around 2,300 years ago, and were a key passage on the ancient Silk Road, serving as a hub for communication among different cultures. The Jiaohe Ancient Ruins form the best-preserved, oldest and largest city of native architecture in the world. The site witnessed the rise and fall of the ancient Turpan civilization as well as exchanges and dissemination of urban cultures, architectural technology, Buddhism and ethnic cultures along the Silk Road. The ruins are of great and unique value in terms of politics, culture, history and art.
