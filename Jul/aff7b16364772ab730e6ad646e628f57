Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday urged the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) to make greater contributions to safeguarding national security and maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks when inspecting the garrison's camp at Central, Hong Kong. He extended sincere greetings to all the staff at the garrison. Xi attended the meeting celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China and the inaugural ceremony of the sixth-term government of the HKSAR. Over the past 25 years, the garrison has strove to implement the "One Country, Two Systems" policy, the HKSAR Basic Law and the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Garrisoning of the HKSAR, he said, hailing its performance in fulfilling various defense duties as excellent. Facing "profound and complex changes" in the situation in Hong Kong in recent years, the garrison has played an important role in the city's transition from chaos to order, Xi said. Noting that Hong Kong is in a crucial stage of transitioning from order to greater prosperity, Xi called on the garrison to enhance capabilities in fulfilling missions and make greater contributions to safeguarding national security, maintaining long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong, and the steady and sustained implementation of "One Country, Two Systems" in the HKSAR.
