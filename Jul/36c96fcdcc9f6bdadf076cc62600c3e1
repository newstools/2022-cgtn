Argentina's lower house congressional leader Sergio Massa will take charge of a new economy "superministry," the government said on Thursday, the latest twist in President Alberto Fernandez's struggle to contain a worsening economic crisis. Under the new move, the economy, productive development and agriculture, livestock and fishery ministries will be absorbed under one role. The appointment came as resignations were offered by some cabinet ministers including the existing Economy Minister Silvina Batakis and Julian Dominguez, minister of agriculture, livestock and fisheries.
