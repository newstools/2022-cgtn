Iran's Foreign Ministry on Sunday refuted a series of claims and accusations against Iran made by U.S. President Joe Biden during his visit to the Middle East. Iran accused the U.S. of using "Iranophobia" to create regional tension. "The United States has once again sought to create tension and crisis in the region by appealing to the failed policy of Iranophobia," Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Nasser Kanaani was quoted by state media as saying in a statement in reaction to Biden's visit. During the tour to the Middle East, Biden has accused Iran of destabilizing the region through its activities, and stated that the U.S. will ensure that "Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon." In the statement, Kanaani said the U.S. president's statement was groundless and in line with its policy of keeping inciting and creating tensions in the region. The spokesperson condemned the United States for trying to create tensions and crises in the region through its continuous interference in the internal affairs of regional countries, repeated military occupations and aggression, and massive arms sales. In the statement, he also condemned America's "blind and unlimited support" for Israel which has infringed upon the rights of the Palestinian people over the past decades. When it comes to the nuclear program, Kanaani restated Iran's strategic policy of peaceful use of nuclear technology within the international legal framework, and said Iran will continue negotiations to lift sanctions. Iran welcomes dialogue and cooperation with regional neighbors to provide constructive efforts for security, peace, stability and development of the region, according to the statement.
