The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted a live-fire drill in the Gobi Desert to test a new type of vehicle-mounted howitzer and strengthen its combat capacity. New long-range shells were used to strike targets more than 30 kilometers away to test targeting efficiency at extreme distances. Compared with traditional crawler-type shells, the new howitzer has a higher degree of digitization and a new control system that allows for one-click firing. The new howitzer also features semi-automatic loading and automatic adjustment that greatly reduce response times.
