China has strengthened its tiered diagnosis and treatment system, and 2,600 community-level medical and health institutions have been built, said China's National Health Commission at a press conference on Friday. More than half of the community-level medical and health institutions in China have met some certain service standards, with 90 percent of county patients receive medical treatment for common diseases within their own regions. By treating the three-tier healthcare system as one, China's 15,000 medical associations can better strengthen the linkage between these hospitals, with the first diagnosis at primary and secondary hospitals, tertiary hospitals providing priority services of reception, and examination and hospitalization for patients referred taking place the the primary and secondary hospitals. China has built over 14,000 emergency centers for treating chest pain, strokes and trauma, and has developed its home-based senior care services. China will develop online diagnosis to improve its medical and health service system, the health regulator said.
