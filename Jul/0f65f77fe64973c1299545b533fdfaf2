In Sri Lanka, the prime minister's office says that President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has informed Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe that he will resign as previously announced. The parliamentary speaker earlier said President Rajapaksa will step down on July 13. This came after thousands of protesters stormed the presidential palace and prime minister's residence on July 9 amid the nation's worst economic crisis in seven decades.
