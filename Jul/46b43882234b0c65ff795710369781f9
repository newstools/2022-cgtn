A part of the Cheng's Bagua Palm, the Bagua Spear is a renowned style of long-weapon Chinese martial arts. The spear moves in unison with the body – the spear head stabs as the shaft swings in sweeping motion. There are multiple ways to wield the spear. It can even be used as a short weapon. Attack with the head and suppress with the shaft or do it the other way round, it has pretty flexible usage. The Bagua Spear incorporates the flexibility of the moves in Bagua Palm – it allows striking while being on the move. It also embraces the power of the spear, mainly in blocking, grabbing, stabbing, lifting, hacking, jumping, rolling and sweeping. Every move requires the combination of the body and the spirit.
