The U.S. supports Canada's decision to return a repaired turbine to Germany that is needed for the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline, the U.S. State Department said on Monday, a move aimed at ensuring continued flows of energy to Europe amid shortages. "In the short term, the turbine will allow Germany and other European countries to replenish their gas reserves, increasing their energy security and resiliency and countering Russia's efforts to weaponize energy," department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. Russia last month cited the delayed return of the turbine, which Germany's Siemens Energy has been servicing in Canada, as the reason behind its reduction of flows to 40 percent of capacity through the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline from Russia to Germany. Canada will return the repaired turbine to Germany and could help to ensure continued flows of energy until Europe can end its dependency on Russian gas, Canada's minister of natural resources said on Saturday. The Canadian government said in a statement that it was issuing a "time-limited and revocable permit" to exempt the return of turbines from its Russian sanctions and also announced new measures against Moscow. Ukraine's energy and foreign ministries said the decision amounted to adjusting sanctions imposed on Moscow "to the whims of Russia" and called for it to be reversed. It was not clear how long it would take for the turbine to be returned. Russian gas delivery through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline has been temporarily suspended starting from Monday for scheduled annual maintenance. The maintenance will last from July 11 to 21, according to a TASS report. (With input from Reuters)
