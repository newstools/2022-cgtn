Manchester United signed Christian Eriksen, the Denmark midfielder who survived a cardiac arrest that caught global attention at Euro 2020, as a free agent on a three-year deal on Friday. The 30-year-old's switch to the Red Devils completes an incredible return after his brush with death last year. Eriksen suffered a cardiac arrest on the pitch in Copenhagen while playing for Denmark at the Euro 2020 and was forced to leave Inter Milan after recovering due to Serie A health regulations. Eriksen, fitted with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator, proved his form and fitness during a loan spell at Brentford in the second half of last season. He played 11 times in the Premier League for the Bees, scoring once and providing four assists. Eriksen has experience working with United manager Erik Ten Hag after training with Ajax as part of his return to football following his cardiac arrest. Ten Hag, who took charge at United in the close-season after leaving the Dutch champions, is looking to revamp his new team after they finished a disappointing sixth in the Premier League last term. Eriksen is Ten Hag's second signing after the arrival of Netherlands left-back Tyrell Malacia from Feyenoord. However, United's plans for the new season have been disrupted by reports Cristiano Ronaldo wants to leave the club after they failed to qualify for next season's Champions League.
