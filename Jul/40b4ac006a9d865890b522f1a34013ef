During a press conference in Geneva on July 27, World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said targeted, rather than mass, vaccination against monkeypox is recommended. More than 18,000 cases of monkeypox have now been reported to the WHO from 78 countries, with more than 70 percent of cases reported from the European region and 25 percent from the region of the Americas.
