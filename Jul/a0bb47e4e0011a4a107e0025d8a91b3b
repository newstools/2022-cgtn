China's crude oil output saw a steady expansion, rising four percent year-on-year in the first six months, official data showed. The growth was bolstered by increased oil and gas production. Relevant enterprises continue to intensify oil and gas exploration and development, effectively promoting the production and stability of crude oil and natural gas, and further enhancing the independent supply guarantee capability, said Hu Hanzhou, director of Energy Statistics Department of the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The crude oil output totaled 102.88 million tonnes from January to June, according to the NBS. In the same period, China imported 252.52 million tonnes of crude oil, down 3.1 percent year-on-year. In June alone, output went up 3.6 percent to 17.19 million tonnes, while imports fell 10.7 percent to 35.82 million tonnes. (With input from Xinhua)
