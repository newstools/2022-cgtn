Bundesliga topflight team Bayern Munich clinched their first title of the season after overpowering RB Leipzig 5-3 to lift their 10th German Super Cup on Saturday. Jamal Musiala gave Bayern the lead in the 14th minute, as he beat RB Leipzig goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi to net the ball into the far post corner. Sadio Mane, who left Liverpool and joined Bayern this summer, doubled the lead at the half-hour mark. The record German champions tripled the advantage just before halftime as Benjamin Pavard latched onto Musiala's cutback pass from close distance. Marcel Halstenberg nodded home Christopher Nkunku's free kick to reduce the deficit for the hosts at the 59th minute, but Bayern responded immediately and restored its three-goal lead after Serge Gnabry made the most on a follow-up shot. RB Leipzig fought back with two goals from Nkunku and Dani Olmo and pressed Bayern into defense, but Bayern denied their hopes of a comeback in injury time after Leroy Sane finished the job in a counterattack.
