The 2nd China International Consumer Products Expo (CICPE), which kicks off on July 26 in Haikou City, is taking an eco-friendly approach to hosting the event. The media center's main structure was built with 100 percent recycled and reusable materials that are easy to assemble. According to the organizer, the CICPE is also laying on a free bus service to shuttle attendees between their hotels and the exhibition center to limit carbon emissions. Food at the event will also be sustainably sourced and prepared.
