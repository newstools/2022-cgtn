Xu Ying, an aerospace information researcher working at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, serves as chief designer for the BeiDou special test system subsystem. She is working with her team to develop BeiDou's application relating to precise weather and climate events. After experiencing failures again and again, she finally achieved her goal of an integrated space-based/ground-based navigation and communication solution. This solution not only completed the first BeiDou's signal enhancement trial in China, but also won the 2018 special prize for scientific and technological progress.
