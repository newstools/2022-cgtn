China is willing to work with the Netherlands to dispel disruptions and jointly maintain stable industrial and supply chains, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi when meeting with Dutch Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra on Friday. The foreign ministers met on the sidelines of the Group of 20 (G20) foreign ministers' meeting in Indonesia's resort island of Bali. This year marks the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and the Netherlands. Noting that globalization enables countries to connect markets, share resources and integrate industries, Wang said that politicizing economic and trade cooperation, and engaging in closed and exclusive small circles, are not only contrary to economic laws, but also detrimental to post-pandemic economic recovery. China will open its door wider to the outside world, with broader areas and at a deeper level, and is willing to work with the Netherlands to elevate bilateral relations to a new high, he added. Hoekstra said the Netherlands attaches great importance to the friendship with China, and hopes to maintain high-level contacts and deepen practical cooperation between the two countries based on the principles of equality, reciprocity and mutual respect. The two sides also exchanged views on the Ukraine issue. Wang said all participants at the G20 foreign ministers' meeting called for a ceasefire as soon as possible, and China would continue to promote peace talks and facilitate dialogues, and support Europe in playing a constructive role in finding a practical solution to the crisis. Hoekstra said his country stands for multilateralism and expects China to play an important role during the process.
