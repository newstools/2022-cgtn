The China DanceSport Federation has released its first ever breakdancing guidebook, with the aim of helping the general public become more familiar with the genre, ahead of its debut as an Olympic event at the Paris Summer Games in 2024.Breakdancing is a style of hip-hop dance that includes dazzling footwork and athletic moves like head or back spins. The International Olympic Committee's search for urban events to pull in younger viewers led to the discipline being added as a medal event in Paris under the name "Breaking at the Olympics." The genre was also an official category at the 2018 Buenos Aires Youth Olympics, and is scheduled to be included when the postponed Hangzhou Asian Games are held next year. The guidebook's design follows benchmarks for teen growth and development, with the aim of cultivating the potential of youth to enter professional competitions in the future.
