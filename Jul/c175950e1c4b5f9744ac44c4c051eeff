After claiming his first Grand Slam of 2022 at Wimbledon, Serbian tennis super star Novak Djokovic said he hopes to play at the US Open this year. He also revealed he's targeting to return to the Australian Open next January, despite his deportation earlier this year from the country over his non-vaccinated status against COVID-19. Djokovic stressed his love for the country where he has won nine out of his 21 Grand Slams. However, the U.S. travel ban on those unvaccinated against COVID-19 continues to stand and Djokovic insisted once again he is not going to change his mind over his status. "I have my stance and I am a proponent always for freedom to choose what is best for you," he said. "I respect everything and everybody and I expect, at least, people to respect my decision. If I have permission, I will be there – if I don't, I will not be there," the former world No.1 added. (With input from AP)
