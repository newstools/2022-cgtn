From the Bronx to Brooklyn, students and parents share their dreams, frustrations and fears with Cecilia Muñoz, former director of the Domestic Policy Council of the United States. "We're in this time in the United States where we are really taking another look at our own history, and reckoning with the things that we fail to understand or chose not to see," she says. "And those things affect us very, very deeply. So that's most vivid with respect to the African American community. We are taking a hard look at the ways in which the ugly history of slavery affects things that we are still living with, that black people in America are still living with. And I'm convinced that it's more difficult to make progress when we don't understand our history."
