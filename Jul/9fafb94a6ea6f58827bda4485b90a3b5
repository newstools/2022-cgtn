United States decathlon medal hopeful Garrett Scantling was ruled out of the World Championships on Thursday after accepting a provisional suspension for an anti-doping rule violation, the United States Anti-Doping Agency said. Scantling, who finished fourth in the Tokyo Olympics last year, was suspended due to his "conduct during an investigation into his third potential whereabouts failure," USADA said in a statement. No further information about the circumstances of his anti-doping rules breach was provided.
