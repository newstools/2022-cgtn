Wudang Monk Spade is a very versatile weapon. Its style allows practitioners to use defense as attack and retreat as advance, either fast or slow, combining hardness and softness. In olden times, Taoists often carried spades when traveling that could be used in self-defense or to pave the road; hence it was also called a "convenient spade." Zhang Haoran, 22, has been based in Wudang Mountain, a sacred Taoist area in China, for eight years. Wudang Monk Spade is his main focus. When he arrived at the Wushu club, Zhang was not strong enough. As the spade is the heaviest weapon in the club, weighing over four kilograms, regular use could improve the lower body muscles and total body strength. The most demanding part of practicing the spade is its weight. The most basic movements, "subduing the dragon" and "taming the tiger," involve hitting the practitioner's body. Because the weapon is heavy, the practitioner can only control it with his body. The monk spade is made of iron sharpened on both ends. Zhang was especially terrified of the move requiring the spade to spin on the back of his head, especially when it was going very fast. To practice this move well, a senior fellow apprentice gave him a stick as a substitute. Zhang got better as a result and started to practice fast spins. Zhang's master is very strict with his apprentices. He requires them to exert all their strength while practicing Wushu. In winter, the boys have to practice topless. After practice, the master would check if they were sweating. He considers anyone not sweating as loafing on the job. Zhang Haoran believes that Wushu has something in common with calligraphy and wind instruments like the flute and Xiao. They require many hours of accumulated practice and maintenance of a certain level. Like calligraphy, there are rules for strokes. It is a long-term endeavor, and perseverance matters.
