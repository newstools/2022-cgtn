A combat support fleet of the People's Liberation Army's Southern Theater Command held multi-pronged day-and-night exercises to bolster its capabilities. The training was carried out in multiple maritime regions and covered maneuvers such as replenishment at sea. All crew members worked together closely and overcame complex weather conditions in simulated combat situations that tested their coordination and combat readiness.
