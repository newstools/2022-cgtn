China and Poland should conduct high-quality cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and deepen practical cooperation in fields such as economy and trade and interconnectivity, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday. Xi made the remarks in a telephone conversation with Polish President Andrzej Duda, calling Poland a prioritized cooperative partner of China in Europe. The two countries should foster new growth points of cooperation in areas such as green development and the digital economy, Xi said. Proposed by the Chinese president in 2013, the BRI comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes. China welcomes more high-quality Polish products to enter its market and encourages more Chinese companies to invest in Poland, he said. The two sides should strive for the establishment of a China-Central and Eastern European countries (CEEC) wholesale market for agricultural products at an early date and jointly prepare for the celebration of the 10th anniversary of the China-CEEC cooperation, he added. Duda said Poland highly values China's international status and role and attaches great importance to its relations with China. Poland stands ready to make joint efforts with China to strive for more outcomes in bilateral cooperation in economy and trade, logistics, interconnectivity and other areas, he said, adding that Poland welcomes more Chinese companies to invest and conduct cooperation in the country. Poland is willing to continue to actively promote the development of the CEEC-China cooperation and Europe-China relations, he said. The two leaders also exchanged views on the Ukraine crisis.
