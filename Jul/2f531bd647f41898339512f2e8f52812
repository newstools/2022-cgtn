Nyanpo Yuzee in Jigzhi County, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai, lies on the eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet plateau. Here, 90 percent of the population are Tibetans, whose families have for generations earned a living as herders. However, over the past 20 years, degradation of the grassland has been posing an increasingly more serious threat, with once-lush pasture turning into vast expanses of black soil. Not only is the herdsmen's livelihood at risk, so, too, is the plateau's biodiversity. The Reawakening of the Grassland is the story of how, in Nyanpo Yuzee in southeast Qinghai, the local government, an environmental NGO, the local community and outside experts are coming together to save the grassland. In 2021, using funding from the Jigzhi County government, the Nyanpo Yuzee Environmental Protection Association recruited 47 locals for a grass-planting project designed to restore not only the degraded pasture, but also the local herders' hopes for the future. The process has faced uncertainty and difficulty, which the herders have met with determination and, sometimes, hesitation.
