New York State Governor Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency due to monkeypox on Friday, as the state accounted for over one quarter of the caseloads found in the nation. "After reviewing the latest data on the monkeypox outbreak in New York State, I am declaring a State Disaster Emergency to strengthen our aggressive ongoing efforts to confront this outbreak," Hochul said in an executive order. There have been 1,383 reported cases of monkeypox in New York and almost 5,000 in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the executive order will allow quick response to the monkeypox outbreak and hasten more New Yorkers to get vaccinated.
