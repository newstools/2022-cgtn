Germany striker Alexandra Popp made light of social media posts saying she could play in the country's men's national team by appearing at Friday's media conference wearing a stick-on mustache. Popp scored both goals in Wednesday's semi-final to defeat France 2-1 and secure Germany a record-extending ninth appearance in the European Championships final. After the game German football website Fums Magazine published a social media post with a mustache photoshopped onto a picture of Popp captioned "Called up by Hansi Flick (German men's head coach) for (FIFA World Cup) Qatar 2022: Alexander Popp." (With input from AP)
