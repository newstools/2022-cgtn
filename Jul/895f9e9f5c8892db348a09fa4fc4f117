Jasprit Bumrah will captain India in Friday's rearranged fifth Test against England, with regular skipper Rohit Sharma unavailable due to COVID-19.The tourists gave Sharma as long as possible to return a negative test on the eve of the match but announced shortly before 1300 local time on Thursday that the fast bowler would lead the side for the first time. Wicketkeeper batsman Rishabh Pant has also been confirmed as vice-captain. The game is the conclusion of last year's five-Test series between the teams, which came to an abrupt end when India withdrew just a couple of hours before the scheduled start at Old Trafford over coronavirus concerns. India lead 2-1 going into the contest. (With input from AP)
