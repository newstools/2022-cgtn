U.S. President Joe Biden's communications director is leaving, the White House disclosed on Wednesday, the latest in a number of departures of high-ranking officials ahead of November's midterm elections. The administration said in a statement confirming Kate Bedingfield's exit later this month that she wants to spend more time with her husband and young children after three years of leading Biden's White House and campaign messaging.
