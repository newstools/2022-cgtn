China encourages Chinese enterprises to invest in Malaysia to help the country speed up its industrialization, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday in Kuala Lumpur. Wang made the remarks when he met with Malaysia's Prime Minister Ismail Sabri Yaakob during his visit in the Southeast Asian country. Speaking highly of the traditional friendship between China and Malaysia, Wang said the two countries maintained a healthy and stable relationship. China always supports the Malaysian side to play an important role in regional and international affairs, Wang said, expressing China's wishes to join hands with Malaysia to inject more stability into the world. For his part, Ismail Sabri said his country is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with China to tackle global challenges like food security and work together to maintain peace and stability. On the same day, Wang also held talks with his Malaysian counterpart Saifuddin Abdullah, vowing to promote bilateral ties to a new level. During Wang's visit, the two countries reached a series of consensus. Both agreed to build the Belt and Road with high quality, establish a pilot zone for production capacity cooperation and a pioneer zone for innovation. China vowed to import more agricultural products of high quality from Malaysia and make efforts to enable Malaysian students to return to China as soon as possible to continue their studies. The two sides advocate open regionalism, true multilateralism, and promise to accelerate the negotiation on the "Code of Conduct in the South China Sea." Wang is on an Asia tour, which takes him to Myanmar, Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia and Malaysia. (Cover: A view of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. /CFP)
