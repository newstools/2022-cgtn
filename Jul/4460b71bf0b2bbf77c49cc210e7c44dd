With the development of science and technology, traditional farming is gradually being transformed, with drones becoming a new farming tool, as an example of the changes. In east China's Suining County, Jiangsu Province, one woman, Li Xinling, specializes in flying agricultural spraying drones. At the end of 2018, Li became the first certified female drone pilot in her village. At that time, a drone cost 80,000 yuan, which was still unaffordable for her family. Finally, Li applied for a business loan from the village to buy the plane.
