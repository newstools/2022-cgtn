At least 18 people were killed due to heavy rain that battered Pakistan from Sunday to Monday, local media reported on Tuesday. Pakistan was hit with a third round of monsoon rains, leading to flash floods that washed away bridges and submerged houses across the country. At least 260 people were rescued from low-lying villages in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Province.
