Various people have warned against the possible trip to China's Taiwan region by Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives. U.S. President Joe Biden said the U.S. military had assessed that "it is not a good idea right now." A Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson said China had repeatedly made clear its firm opposition to Pelosi's potential visit. Taiwan's businessman Peng Yin-gang warned that a visit from Pelosi could create serious tensions in the Taiwan Straits and even accidentally spark a conflict.
