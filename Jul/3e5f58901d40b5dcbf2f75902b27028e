One more person was rescued in the early hours of Monday after Typhoon Chaba sank a vessel in waters near Yangjiang City, south China's Guangdong Province, over the weekend. A total of 30 crew members abandoned Fujing 001, a vessel for offshore wind power project construction, after its anchor chain broke in the typhoon on July 2. Earlier media reports said the vessel had split into two. So far, four people have been rescued and search continues for the remaining missing persons. On July 2, three people were found by the rescue helicopter of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government Flying Team.
