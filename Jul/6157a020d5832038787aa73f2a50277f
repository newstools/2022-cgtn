On Thursday the Italian government won a confidence motion in the upper house of parliament on measures aimed at helping counter the cost of living crisis, however the 5-Star Movement, a senior partner in Draghi's ruling coalition, carried out its threat to boycott the vote. The confidence vote, which passed 172 votes to 39, was used to expedite parliamentary clearance of a multi-billion euro aid package. After the vote, a government source said Draghi went directly to see President Sergio Mattarella, who will have to decide how to resolve the crisis. (With input from Reuters)
