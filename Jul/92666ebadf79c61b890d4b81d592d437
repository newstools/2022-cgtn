One migrant was killed, and at least six others, including a teenage girl, were injured on Saturday in a shootout between migrant groups in Serbia near the Hungarian border, the state-run RTS television reported. The incident occurred in a forest on the outskirts of Subotica, some 160 kilometers north of Belgrade, where the injured were hospitalized. Police did not immediately comment on the cause of the shootout, but the local media said it occurred between Afghan and Pakistani migrants, most likely over human trafficking from the area to Hungary.
