The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday said the three joint communiques are the "guardrails" in China-U.S. relations and urged the U.S. side to honor its commitments. U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Daniel Kritenbrink on Tuesday said the U.S. will discuss having "guardrails" in U.S.-China relations so that the "competition does not spill over into miscalculation or confrontation" during an upcoming meeting between U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. "The U.S. side is always talking about 'guardrails,'" said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. "The 'guardrails' in China-U.S. relations are the three China-U.S. joint communiques." The bilateral relationship between China and the United States is the most important bilateral relations in the world, and the two countries should make the relationship work, not mess it up, said Zhao. Both sides should uphold the principles of mutual respect and win-win cooperation and promote the relations' return to healthy and stable development, he said. "What the United States should do is to abide by the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques and honor the commitments it has made to the Chinese side."
