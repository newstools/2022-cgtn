An infrared camera placed in the forest in Beichuan Qiang Autonomous County, northern Sichuan Province, recorded a wild giant panda on July 6. It is the fifth time that images of wild giant pandas in the forest have been captured since May. The footage has revealed pandas' behaviors such as foraging, scent-marking and playing. The pandas appear to be in healthy condition. (All images are screenshots) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
