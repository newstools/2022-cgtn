Thirty people were burnt to death when three vehicles collided on a highway in northwest Nigeria's Kaduna state, a road safety official said Friday. The accident occurred on Thursday when two buses and a car rammed into one another at Hawan Mai Mashi village along the 400-kilometre highway linking the city of Kano and the nation's capital Abuja, said Abdurrahman Yakasai, a Federal Road Safety Corps official in Zaria district. Several other passengers were also injured, he said. "Other passengers sustained serious injuries and our personnel took them to hospital, where they are being treated," he said. Yakasai blamed the accident on speeding and reckless driving.
