In a Washington Post op-ed published on Saturday, U.S. President Joe Biden wrote that during his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia, he aims to "strengthen a strategic partnership going forward that's based on mutual interests and responsibilities." Biden asserted that "a more secure and integrated Middle East benefits Americans in many ways," adding that "its waterways are essential to global trade and the supply chains we rely on [and] its energy resources are vital for mitigating the impact on global supplies" due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.
