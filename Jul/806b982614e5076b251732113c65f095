Former Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was granted a short-term visit pass (STVP) when he arrived in the country, Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in Singapore said on Wednesday. "Visitors from Sri Lanka who enter Singapore for the purpose of social visits will generally be issued with an STVP with duration of up to 30 days," ICA mentioned in a statement, reiterating that Rajapaksa had entered Singapore on a private visit. The former president arrived in Singapore on July 14, fleeing from a worsening economic crisis in Sri Lanka. Singapore's foreign ministry stated that Rajapaksa has neither asked for asylum nor has been granted any asylum.
