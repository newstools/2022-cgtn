The political space to revive the Iran nuclear deal may narrow soon, the EU's top diplomat Josep Borrell said on Tuesday, after speaking to Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian. "If we want to conclude an agreement, decisions are needed now," Borrell wrote on Twitter, adding that it was still possible to revive the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
