"Originally, I'm from Long Island, so from that transition to here is very different. I transitioned to a new school, called Urban Dove TEAM Charter. Nobody's encouraging me to do anything in that school, and it's very, very hard. The work is not as easy. There's no counsellors in my school. It's really bad," said Lia Rivero.
