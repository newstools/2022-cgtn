Dating back to the ancient Zhou and Qin dynasties (1046 B.C.-207 B.C.), which originated in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, Red Quan is a type of fist that combines traditional Chinese culture with martial arts. The Red Quan's technique is characterized by agility, flexibility, clarity of thought, obvious offensive and defensive moves, and strength. Li Quanhai teaches at the Training Department of Shaanxi Police College. He incorporates the Red Quan in his daily teaching, especially the use of the "crossing hands." He thinks the police require such defense and control moves for restraining opponents and overpowering them than beating them up. The Red Quan involves seven systems, each with its unique features. One must learn the positions, moves, routines and theories. Positions are the foundation and the root of the Red Quan. It trains your tendons, hips and waist, activating the whole body. Moves include those of the abdomen, legs and feet. The Red Quan has clever moves. The steps should be very agile, and one needs to keep the body flexible. In learning kung fu, it is better to be the master of one skill than jack of all. The goal of practicing is to keep yourself flexible and agile. "While teaching at the college, I find some students interested in practicing routines. They believe that it's better to learn more of them for a good performance. There are also some students who practice very hard, but when they graduate and go to work, most of them don't think about practicing it anymore. I hope the spirit of wushu could run through their lives," said Li.
