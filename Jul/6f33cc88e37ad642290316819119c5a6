The Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on Wednesday that it has severed diplomatic relations with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) in response to its decision to recognize the independence of territories in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Ukraine. In a statement, the Ukrainian office denounced the DPRK's decision as an attempt by Pyongyang to undermine the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine, and severed ties with the DPRK in response.. The move makes the DPRK the third country after Russia and Syria to recognize the two breakaway entities. DPRK's official media outlet KCNA confirmed on Thursday the country's Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui sent letters to her counterparts in both territories on Wednesday, recognizing their independence. "In the letters, she ... expressed the will to develop the state-to-state relations with those countries in the idea of independence, peace and friendship," KCNA said.
