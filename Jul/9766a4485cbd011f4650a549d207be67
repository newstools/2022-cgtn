People eligible for COVID-19 vaccinations will have to take the shot before entering crowded venues in Beijing, health experts said at a press conference held in Beijing on Wednesday. From next Monday, people wishing to enter crowded venues such as libraries, museums and cinemas would need to be vaccinated, except those who are not suitable for vaccination, said Li Ang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Health Commission. People who have got vaccinated will be given priority in venues, where people are limited to a certain number and reservations are needed, Li added. Over 23.09 million people in Beijing were vaccinated as of April 17, according to statistics released by the Beijing Municipal Health Commission. Still, the city is encouraging the elderly to get vaccinated. As of April 17, 80.6 percent of those aged 60 and above in Beijing had received their first dose and 80 percent got booster shots. The elderly who visit certain venues offering activities specifically for the seniors, such as universities and fitness places for the elderly, should be vaccinated as soon as possible, said Li. For domestic travel, the capital now restricts entry by people who, within seven days, have traveled in towns or cities that have recently reported one local infection or more, compared with 14 days earlier. The genetic sequencing results of three COVID-19 cases reported on Tuesday showed Omicron sub-variant BA.5.2 made up its cases, which were caused by imported cases from overseas, said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing center for disease control and prevention. Beijing has reported 12 new COVID-19 cases from Monday to Wednesday as of 3 p.m., all of whom were already isolated for medical observation.
