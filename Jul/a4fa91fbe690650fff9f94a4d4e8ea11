Iran has the technical capabilities to manufacture a nuclear bomb, but has made no decision to do so, Kamal Kharazi, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said on Sunday. "In a few days we were able to enrich uranium up to 60 percent and we can easily produce 90 percent enriched uranium ... Iran has the technical means to produce a nuclear bomb but there has been no decision by Iran to build it," Kharrazi said, adding that Tehran would never negotiate over its missile program and regional policy.
