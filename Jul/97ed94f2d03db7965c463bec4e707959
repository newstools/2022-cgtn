"The situation is now calm," state health minister Jamal Nasser told AFP, adding that the deployment of the army had eased the fighting since Saturday. Fighting broke out in the state on the borders with Ethiopia and South Sudan on July 11 between members of the Berti and Hausa ethnic groups. (With input from AFP)
