The 14th summit of BRICS, an emerging-market group that includes Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, was held on June 23 in virtual format under China's chairmanship. As the world is faced with numerous uncertainties, including a pandemic unseen in a century and the Russian-Ukraine conflict, the five major developing countries are expected to contribute their efforts to promoting global development. Earlier CGTN host Tian Wei talked to Marcos Troyjo, President of the New Development Bank, backed by BRICS countries, about the BRICS cooperation and the bank's green infrastructure development.
