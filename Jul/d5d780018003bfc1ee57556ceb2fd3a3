Teams will be allowed to play at home in the second stage of the 2022 Chinese Super League (CSL) season that will begin on August 5, the Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced at an online press conference on Wednesday. The second stage of the season will start with Round 11. Teams having difficulties playing at their original home can seek neutral ground. For example, Guo Bingyan of the CFA suggested teams based in Shanghai can go to play in the neighboring Jiangsu or Zhejiang Provinces. There are currently two teams of Shanghai in the CSL, Shanghai Shenhua and Shanghai Port. Reporter Zhaoyu revealed that about half of the league’s 18 teams will seek neutral grounds to play at. CSL teams have ceased to play at home since December 2, 2019, because of COVID-19. The 2022 season has wrapped up eight rounds of games by Monday. Wuhan Three Towns remained unbeaten with a 7-1 record, leading on the table. The reigning champions Shandong Taishan are four points behind. Dalian Professional, which replaced dissolved Chongqing Liangjiang Athletic in the CSL, ranked 11th with 10 points. Traditional powerhouse Guangzhou have been struggling since the 2022 season began, winning only one game and ranking 16th on the table. The first stage of the 2022 CSL still has two rounds to go. Wuhan Three Towns are playing against Wuhan Yangtze River in the "Wuhan Derby" on Friday.
