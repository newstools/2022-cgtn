The South China Botanical Garden in the city of Guangzhou was officially upgraded to a "national botanical garden" earlier this month. The organization was founded in 1929. It's the largest subtropical botanical garden in the world, with nearly 20,000 different species of plants. CGTN reporter Cao Chufeng shows you some of the many interesting species, including an endangered one that can only be found inside the garden. She also speaks to the experts inside the garden about their work in helping preserve biodiversity in China.
