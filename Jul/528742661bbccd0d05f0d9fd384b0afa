A health insurance forum was held in Haikou, Hainan Province Wednesday on the sidelines of this year's China International Consumer Products Expo. Over 200 participants held online and offline discussions on how commercial health insurance can be used to improve people's lives in China and the role that the Hainan Free Trade Port can play in promoting the sector. The island province is already playing a key role in the country's health sector as a pilot zone for testing imported medicines that are yet to be approved in China. Besides, the province has also launched the world's first special drug insurance for treatment of cancer tumors. Experts said that an extensive drug insurance system is necessary for the development of the medical tourism sector in the Hainan Free Trade Port area.
