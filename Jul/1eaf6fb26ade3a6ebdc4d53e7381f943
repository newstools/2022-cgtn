The United States has only a slim chance of avoiding an economic downturn given the many risks it faces, the IMF said Tuesday. "It's a very narrow path," IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said. "The current environment suggests that the likelihood that the U.S. economy can avoid a recession is actually quite narrow." He warned that even a "small shock" could tip the U.S. economy into recession.
