A Ukrainian airplane carrying "dangerous cargo," with a crew of eight, crashed in northern Greece on July 16. The cause of the crash was failure of one of the plane's engines. The flight was en route from Serbia to Jordan when it crashed, and the plane's final destination was Bangladesh. Serbian officials said the plane was carrying 11.5 tons of military products to Bangladesh. The products were owned by a private Serbian company. All eight members of the crew were killed in the crash.
