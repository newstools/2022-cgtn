China's Wang Manyu and Wang Chuqin came back from two games down to claim the World Table Tennis (WTT) Star Contender European Summer Series 2022 mixed doubles title over Japanese duo Tomokazu Harimoto and Hina Hayata 3-2 on Saturday. The Chinese pair lost the first two games 11-9, 11-6 before they rallied back to win the last three 11-7, 11-7 and 11-9. Wang Manyu admitted that her knee injury made it difficult for her to win and she later announced that she would withdraw from the women's singles contention, which sent compatriot Sun Yingsha directly to the final. Wang herself would focus on the women's doubles final with Sun, facing Japanese pair Mima Ito and Hina Hayata. Sun will meet, in the women's singles final, compatriot Wang Yidi who defeated Japan's Kasumi Ishikawa 4-2 on Sunday, while the men's doubles final features China's Liang Jingkun and Lin Gaoyuan against South Korea's Cho Dae-seong and Lee Sang-su.
