Pakistan's main policy rate has been hiked 125 basis points to 15 percent, the country's acting central bank governor Murtaza Syed said on Thursday. Syed's announcement at a virtual press conference followed a meeting of the central bank's Monetary Policy Committee, days after inflation in Pakistan surged to a 13-year high in June.
