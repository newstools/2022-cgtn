A joint coordination center for Ukrainian grain exports officially opened in a ceremony in Türkiye's Istanbul on Wednesday. The center will be staffed by civilian and military officials from Russia and Ukraine and delegates from Türkiye and the United Nations. Their primary assignment involves monitoring the safe passage of Ukrainian grain ships along established routes and overseeing their inspection for banned weapons on the way into and out of the Black Sea, Turkish Defense Minister Hulusi Akar said on Wednesday at the ceremony."The staff working at this center are aware that the eyes of the world are upon them," Akar told reporters in his opening address. "It is our hope that the center will make greatest contribution possible to humanitarian needs and peace." Preparations are continuing for the first ships to leave Ukrainian ports under a landmark UN deal to export Ukrainian grains, Akar added. Ukraine confirmed on Wednesday that work had resumed at three Black Sea ports designated under a recent deal with Russia to resume the export of cereals. "In connection with the signing of the agreement on the unblocking of Ukrainian ports for the export of grain, work has resumed in the ports of Odesa, Chornomorsk and Pivdennyi," the Ukrainian navy said in a statement on social media. The center has been set up "in accordance with the provisions of the mutual understanding initiative for the safe transportation of grain from the ports of Ukraine," the Russian Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. Russia and Ukraine signed a deal with Türkiye and the United Nations on July 22 to resume grain shipments from Ukrainian ports to international markets via the Black Sea. (With input from agencies)
