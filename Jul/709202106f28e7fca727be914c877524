Former Arsenal and England midfielder Jack Wilshere announced his retirement from football on Friday at the age of 30. Wilshere - who also played for West Ham United among four other clubs towards the end of his career - won 34 England caps and said he had "lived my dream" in the game. Reports on Friday suggested Arsenal were set to name Wilshere as their new Under-18s head coach. (With input from AP)
