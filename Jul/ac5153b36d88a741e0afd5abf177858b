Mali's army said it repelled a "terrorist attack" on Friday against its main base outside the capital Bamako, which was carried out with car bombs. "The provisional death toll is two assailants neutralised," it said in a tweet. "The situation is under control and clearing operations are under way to flush out the authors and their accomplices."
