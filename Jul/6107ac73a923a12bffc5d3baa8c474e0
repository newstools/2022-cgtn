The first train under the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan road-rail intermodal transport system was launched from the Urumqi International Land Port in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, China, on Thursday. The train's cargo – 204 tonnes of cloth and cotton yarn – will be offloaded at Kashgar Train Station and then taken by road to the Kyrgyz border at the Irkeshtam crossing point and on to Tashkent, Uzbekistan. The cargo train adopting the road-rail transport method marks a breakthrough in the intermodal transport system between China and European and Central Asian countries. The method with simplified escrow, payment and insurance processes has largely improved transport efficiency, and will contribute the convenience to the trade between China and central Asia, CMG reported.
