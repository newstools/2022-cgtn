Iran has sent a response to European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell's proposal aimed at salvaging the 2015 nuclear deal, and seeks a swift conclusion to the negotiations, Iran's top nuclear negotiator Ali Bagheri Kani said in a tweet on Sunday. "As Iran, we stand ready to conclude the negotiations in a short order, should the other side be ready to do the same," he added. Borrell said on Tuesday he had proposed a new draft text to revive the Iran nuclear deal, adding there was no room left for further major compromises.
