July fourth is America's Independence Day. It's a day marking the country's freedom from oppression; a day for family reunions, picnics, parades and fireworks. But this year, it became a day marred by gunshots, violence, protests and division. What's unusual for this year – at a time to celebrate liberty – is that Americans are sadly seeing that very liberty being stripped away, contributing to an ever-divided nation with the rich getting richer, and the poor getting poorer. With gun violence, racial tensions, political polarization, eroding rights and an ever-widening income gap, the America of the past is gone, and the America of today is in a crisis. With only 39 percent of Americans proud of their country – according to a recent Fox News survey – for most Americans today, the cost of liberty in "the land of the free" is coming at too high a price. CGTN's newly-released feature "The Disappearing American Dream" takes a hard look at what has gone wrong with America and explores the root causes behind it.
