The death toll in a boat mishap in Nigeria's commercial capital Lagos has risen to 15 with one person missing, emergency officials said Sunday as they recover more bodies. A total of 16 passengers, including children, were on board when the accident happened Friday night, local media said. The Lagos State Waterways Authority (LASWA) also confirmed the accident. "A W19 passenger Fibre boat carrying 16 people capsized along the Ojo area of the state," said LASWA area manager Sarat Braimah. "The boat... broke the waterways rules of late travelling by setting sail at 7:45 p.m. (1845 GMT)." Braimah said the tide carried the boat towards a barge and caused it to overturn, adding that the passengers were not wearing life jackets. (With input from AFP)
