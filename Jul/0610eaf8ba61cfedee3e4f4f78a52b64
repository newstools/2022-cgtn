New Monaco signings Takumi Minamino and Breel Embolo faced the French media for the first time at the club's training base in La Turbie on Wednesday. Japan international Minamino joined the club on a four-year contract at the end of June after failing to nail down a first team place during his 2.5 years with Liverpool. Embolo, a Switzerland international who was born in Cameroon, completed his move to Monaco from Borussia Monchengladbach last Friday, also signing a four-year deal. (With input from AP)
