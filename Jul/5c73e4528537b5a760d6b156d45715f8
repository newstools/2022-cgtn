At least three people were rescued after a cargo ship broke into two about 300 kilometers southwest of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region during Typhoon Chaba on Saturday morning, local media reported. A total of 30 crew members abandoned the ship when the incident happened, the Hong Kong Government Flying Service previously said. Searches for remaining crew members are still ongoing. The Hong Kong Government Flying Service said that the site was very close to the eye center of the typhoon and clusters of multiple wind power generation nearby are also making the operation difficult and dangerous.
