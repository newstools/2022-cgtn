The Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), which operates the U.S. state of Texas' electric power grid, on Sunday warned of the potential for rolling blackouts on Monday. The state faces a "potential reserve capacity shortage with no market solution available," ERCOT said in an operating notice posted on its website. Record temperatures are expected across much of the state on Monday. ERCOT has appealed for conservation of energy from 2 p.m. to 8 p.m. on Monday. (With input from Reuters)
