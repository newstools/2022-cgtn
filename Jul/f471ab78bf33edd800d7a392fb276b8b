Britain's Met Office weather forecaster on Friday declared a national emergency, issuing a red "Extreme Heat" warning for parts of England for Monday and Tuesday next week when temperatures could reach record highs. "Exceptional, perhaps record-breaking, temperatures are likely on Monday, then again on Tuesday," the Met Office said on their website.
