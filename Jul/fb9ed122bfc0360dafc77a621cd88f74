British Prime Minister Boris Johnson vowed Wednesday to carry on with his role, despite more than a dozen MPs resigning from the government in the last 24 hours, in protest over his handling of scandals including the case of a senior official accused of sexual misconduct. "The job of a prime minister in difficult circumstances when you have been handed a colossal mandate is to keep going and that's what I'm going to do," Johnson told MPs in parliament.
