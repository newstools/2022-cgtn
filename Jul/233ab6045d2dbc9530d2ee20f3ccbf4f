Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) has filed for bankruptcy in the United States, the airline said on Tuesday, warning strike action by pilots had impacted its financial position and liquidity. Wage talks between SAS and its pilots collapsed on Monday, triggering a strike that adds to travel chaos across Europe as the peak summer vacation period begins. The company said in a statement on Tuesday it would continue to serve its customers throughout the bankruptcy process, although the pilot strike is impacting its flight schedule.
