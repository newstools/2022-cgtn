Mali would suspend all new rotations of the United Nations' MINUSMA peacekeeping mission from Thursday, including those already arranged, the foreign ministry said. It also added that the suspension would last until a meeting is held to "facilitate the coordination and regulation" of the rotation of these contingents, AFP reported on Thursday.
