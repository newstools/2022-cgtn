Alexandra Popp scored twice to power Germany to a 2-1 win over France on Wednesday and into the final of the European Women's Championship against England. With the game level at 1-1 and both teams missing chances to score, Germany captain Popp leaped above the French defense in the 76th minute to send a bouncing header into the French goal. Popp scored the opening goal for Germany in the 40th, but the lead lasted less than five minutes before France equalized. Popp has scored in all five of Germany's games so far – a new record – after missing the last two European Championships in 2013 and 2017 because of injuries. Germany play host nation England in Sunday's final at Wembley Stadium. Popp and England's Beth Mead are the joint top scorers with six goals each. "I can't find any words. We played a crazy game; we threw in everything we had," Popp told German broadcaster ZDF. "We're now in the final against England in front of 90,000 at Wembley. To be honest, there's nothing better."
