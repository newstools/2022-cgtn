French Prime Minister Elisabeth Borne on Monday survived a motion of no-confidence brought against her by a broad alliance of left-wing opponents. An official vote count showed that 146 lawmakers voted in support of the motion, which required an absolute majority of 289 votes to precipitate the government's downfall. "We should be debating the issues the French are facing, this non-confidence vote is unfair," the prime minister told the parliament just before the vote. "This non-confidence vote is just political tactics ... Let's switch together to a culture of compromise," she added. The no-confidence motion had been expected to fail after the conservative Les Republicains party and Marine Le Pen's far-right Rassemblement National said they would abstain. Now that the no-confidence motion is out the way, the parliament will soon start discussing the 20 billion euro ($20.13 billion) inflation-relief package unveiled last week by the government.
