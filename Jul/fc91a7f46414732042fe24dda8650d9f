It is the 85th anniversary of the July 7 Incident. The day when the Japanese army launched an assault on Lugou Bridge in Beijing as a pretext for the overall invasion of China marks the beginning of the all-out Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45). Chinese people from all walks of life are commemorating the occasion. CGTN brings live coverage from several historical sites, including September 18 Historical Museum in Shenyang, Nanjing Massacre Museum and Lugou Bridge to offer a good opportunity for a better understanding of the event.
