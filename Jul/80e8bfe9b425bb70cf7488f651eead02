The U.S. House of Representatives will vote next week on more than $500 billion in proposed spending to keep the government running, as leaders work to pass annual funding bills before lawmakers recess next month, The Hill reported on Monday. The lawmakers will vote on a six-bill package that includes money for the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Agriculture, Energy and Veterans Affairs, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.
