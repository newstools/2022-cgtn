U.S. President Joe Biden tested positive for COVID-19 again on Saturday morning in what the White House doctor describes as a "rebound" case seen in a small percentage of patients who take the antiviral drug Paxlovid. Biden, 79, who emerged from COVID-19 isolation on Wednesday after testing positive on July 21, will now return to strict isolation, the White House said.
