The Kenyan government and the World Health Organization (WHO) on Saturday launched a medical emergency hub in Nairobi, the first in a network of African centers aimed at hastening responses to regional emergencies. The facility will include a training center, and house professionals who can respond to a medical emergency within its first 24 hours and stockpiles of medical equipment.
