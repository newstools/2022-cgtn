With a pair of grayish spectacles, a white mouth and a proud tuft atop the head, this troop of creatures swinging amid the forests is one of the most notable species in Jingdong Yi Autonomous County, southwest China's Yunnan Province. They're called the Indo-Chinese gray langurs. Not so well-known as its neighbor, the western black-crested gibbon, the langur is less constrained by geography. They can live at all altitudes and range freely in the mountains.
