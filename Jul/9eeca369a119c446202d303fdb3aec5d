The death toll from a boat that capsized while carrying a wedding party in Pakistan earlier this week is presumed to have surpassed 50 after officials said on Wednesday there was no hope of finding more survivors. The overcrowded vessel was carrying around 100 passengers when it capsized Monday on the storm-swollen Indus River in Sadiqabad, central Punjab province. "It's been more than 48 hours since the incident, so there's no chance of finding survivors," Kashif Nisar Gill, a spokesperson for the district administration, told AFP.
