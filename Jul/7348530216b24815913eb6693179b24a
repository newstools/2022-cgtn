The current turmoil in the international situation has vindicated Chinese President Xi Jinping's foresight that the world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday. Wang made the remarks at a symposium on the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy in Beijing. Noting the "black swan" and "gray rhino" events in the international situation recently, Wang said they have fully proved President Xi's foresight about the world's changes and turbulence. A "black swan" is an unforeseen event that has potentially severe consequences, while a "gray rhino" refers to a visible yet ignored threat. Since 2017, Xi has stressed on many occasions that the world is "undergoing profound changes unseen in a century," and entering "a new period of turbulence and transformation." The Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy consists of 10 principles, including building a global community of a shared future to safeguard world peace and promote common development, pursuing peaceful development on the basis of mutual respect and win-win cooperation, and steering reform of the global governance system to promote greater equity and justice. The key principles also include pursuing major-country diplomacy with distinctive Chinese features to accomplish the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, pursuing the Belt and Road Initiative under the principles of extensive consultation and joint contribution to benefit all, and upholding China's sovereignty, national security, and development interests as the core and non-negotiable position. On Sunday, attendees of the symposium said the Xi Jinping Thought on Diplomacy has contributed Chinese wisdom and Chinese solutions to major global problems.
