The European Commission on Friday launched four new infringement proceedings against Britain over its failure to implement Brexit divorce terms to govern trade with Northern Ireland. "Despite repeated calls by the European Parliament, the 27 EU member states and the European Commission to implement the Protocol (on Northern Ireland), the UK government has failed to do so," a statement from the EU's executive arm said.
