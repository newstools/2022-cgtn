Four people were killed, and two were injured at a mall in the U.S. state of Indiana after a man with a rifle opened fire in a food court. The man entered the Greenwood Park Mall with a rifle and several magazines of ammunition and began firing in the food court. An armed civilian killed the gunman. The authorities are searching the mall for other victims, but they believe the shooting was contained in the food court. The police also confiscated a suspicious backpack that was in a bathroom near the food court. The Indianapolis Metropolitan Police and multiple other agencies are assisting in the investigation.
