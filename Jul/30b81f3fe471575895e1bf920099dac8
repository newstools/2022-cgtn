China is closely following Pakistan's investigation into a terrorist attack on the Confucius Institute in Karachi and hopes perpetrators will be brought to justice, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday. A day before, Pakistan said it had arrested a militant who provided technical support for the deadly suicide bomb attack on Chinese teachers at the institute in Karachi University in April. Sharjeel Memon, information minister of Pakistan's Sindh province, told a press conference that the attack was the result of the combined efforts of two separatist groups, the Balochistan Liberation Front (BLF) and the Balochistan Liberation Army. The accused man, Dad Bakash, was arrested from Karachi's district west on Monday and confessed to being commander of a sleeper cell of the BLF, he said. The terrorist attack was aimed at "sabotaging China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project and stopping foreign investment in Pakistan," Memon said.
