The death toll from a cloudburst that hit near a Hindu cave shrine in Indian-controlled Kashmir rose to 16 on Saturday, officials said, with more than 40 still missing. "Sixteen people have been confirmed dead. About 40 still seem to be missing," National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) Director-General Atul Karwal was quoted by local media reports as having said. The downpour triggered a flash flood on Friday evening that swept away makeshift tents and community kitchens near the Amarnath shrine.
