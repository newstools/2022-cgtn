Nick Kyrgios was fined $10,000 for misconduct during his opening singles match at Wimbledon. The 27 year-old Australian admitted to spitting in the direction of a "disrespectful" fan and called a line judge a "snitch" in an ill-tempered five-set win over Britain's Paul Jubb on Tuesday. Kyrgios let his tennis do the talking in his second round match on Thursday, an impressive three-set win over Serbia's Filip Krajinovic. That set up a third round encounter with Greek number four seed Stefanos Tsitsipas.
