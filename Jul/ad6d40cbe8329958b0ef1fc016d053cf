The secretary of Armenia's Security Council, Armen Grigoryan, said on Tuesday that the Armenian military units will completely withdraw from the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September. "After the establishment of a ceasefire and the deployment of Russian's peacekeeping contingent, the withdrawal of the Armenian Armed Forces units is logical," Grigoryan added.
