At least 10 inmates and a security official were killed after suspected Boko Haram gunmen attacked a prison outside the Nigerian capital, using explosives to free some jailed jihadists, according to local media. The gunmen used bombs to gain control of the facility on Tuesday and released over 855 inmates including their members, according to the report. "We understand they are Boko Haram, they came specifically for their co-conspirators," senior interior ministry official Shuaibu Belgore told reporters.
