China on Friday urged Japan to be cautious about its words and deeds on the Taiwan question after a parliamentary delegation led by former Japanese defense ministers arrived in China's Taiwan on Wednesday. Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks on Friday while commenting on the visit. Some Japanese lawmakers and politicians have frequently taken erroneous actions and spread false statements on Taiwan-related issues, which is very dangerous, Zhu said.
