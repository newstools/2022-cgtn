Zhang Tianyu, who has been working in Beijing for nine years, runs a Taekwondo hall. Due to a new round of COVID-19 outbreaks this May, Zhang started to work as an SF deliveryman to pay the rent of his Taekwondo hall and cover his daily expenses. Zhang found it very meaningful to do something for those who worked from home in Beijing.
