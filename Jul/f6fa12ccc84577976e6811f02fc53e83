Morgan Stanley's Chief China Economist Robin Xing says "growth has bottomed, and the recovery has started." China's real estate investment fell 5.4-percent in the first-half of the year, but Robin believes policy stimulus and the reopening of the Chinese economy will help to stabilize the housing market. He notes China still has plenty of room for policy stimulus in the second half of 2022 as the country has inflation under control.
