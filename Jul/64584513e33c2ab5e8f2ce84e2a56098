Nominations for a new president of Sri Lanka were presented to lawmakers in parliament on Tuesday. They will vote on Wednesday to elect the new leader. The final list came after Sajith Premadasa, the leader of the opposition of Sri Lanka, has withdrawn his presidential candidacy from consideration. The acting President Ranil Wickremesinghe, legislators Anura Kumara Dissanayake and Dullas Alahapperuma are now competing in the race. The race to select Sri Lanka's next president has begun, as Gotabaya Rajapaksa resigned after fleeing to Singapore. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is currently the interim president. The new president could hold office for the remaining two years of Rajapaksa's term before fresh elections in 2024.
