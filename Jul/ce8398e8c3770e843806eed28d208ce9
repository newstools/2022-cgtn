On the afternoon of July 18, short-term severe convective weather hit Harbin City, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The cumulus thundercloud spewed a "wall of rain" into the sky. The scene was quite spectacular and breathtaking. Check out the video provided by the China Meteorological Administration to witness the scene. (Cover image via VCG.)
