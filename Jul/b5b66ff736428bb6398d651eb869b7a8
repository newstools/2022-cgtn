The number of people killed in an avalanche in the Italian Dolomites rose to 11 on Saturday, police said, adding that the death toll was not expected to increase further. A section of Italy's biggest Alpine glacier gave way last Sunday, sending ice and rock hurtling down the mountain, in a disaster blamed by officials on climate change. "We've reached a toll of 11. As of today, we have no indications to make us think more people could be involved," said Colonel Giampietro Lago from the police scientific department. All the deceased have been identified.
