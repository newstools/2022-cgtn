Officials of San Francisco, California, declared a state of emergency on Thursday in response to the growing spread of monkeypox across the city. "We want the flexibility to be able to use our resources to best serve the public and protect health," San Francisco Health Officer Susan Philip said. Philip emphasized that she was not planning to call for any closures or restrictions, which distinguishes the emergency declaration from the health orders issued amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
