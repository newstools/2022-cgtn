Eight-time women's European champions Germany cruised clinically into the Women's Euro 2022 quarterfinals as Group B winners with a game to spare on Tuesday after beating Spain 2-0. Spain, who had hoped for a historic first win over Germany, enjoyed far more possession but lacked the final touch against opponents who pressed hard and were quick to seize their chances. Germany were gifted a goal in the 3rd minute after a blunder by Spain goalkeeper Sandra Panos, whose attempted clearance went straight to Klara Buehl for her to slot home into the bottom corner. Alexandra Popp, making her first start after striker Lea Schuller tested positive for COVID-19 the day before, doubled the tally for Germany in the 37th with a flicked header off a corner. The defeat in front of a 16,000-strong crowd left Spain level on three points with Denmark, who beat Finland 1-0 earlier, but ahead on goal difference. Spain and Denmark will play each other on Saturday with Spain needing a point to set up a quarterfinal with hosts England.
