Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha survived a fourth no-confidence vote on Saturday, along with 10 of his cabinet ministers, after a four-day debate in the parliament, according to Reuters. Thailand's opposition parties filed the censure motion in June, accusing the government of graft and economic mismanagement.
