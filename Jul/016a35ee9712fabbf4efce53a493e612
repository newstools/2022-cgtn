China and Indonesia have iconic cooperative projects, such as the Jakarta-Bandung High-Speed Railway, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Corridor and the China-Indonesia "Two Countries, Twin Parks." They demonstrate a model of mutual benefit and win-win relationship. Chinese Ambassador to Indonesia Lu Kang told CGTN's Tian Wei that he is quite optimistic that these projects will be accomplished in a very high quality and timely way, as wished by the people on both sides.
