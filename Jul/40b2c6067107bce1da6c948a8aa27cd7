U.S. President Joe Biden tested negative for COVID-19 on Tuesday evening and Wednesday morning and will discontinue his strict isolation measures, his physician Kevin O'Connor said in a statement on Wednesday. The 79-year-old tested positive for the virus last Thursday. Biden will continue to wear a mask for 10 full days while he's around others, and will increase his testing frequency given the possibility for a "rebound," the statement said. Biden remains fever free, and his symptoms are almost completely resolved, it said. In a tweet, the U.S. president wrote, "Back to the Oval. Thanks to Doc for the good care, and to all of you for your support."
