The South China National Botanical Garden, the second of its kind in the country, was unveiled in Guangzhou on Monday after the first opened in Beijing this April. The South China National Botanical Garden is the largest subtropical botanical garden in the world and one of the oldest botanical research and plant protection institutions in China. The total area of the exhibition and scientific research areas is 333 hectares. So far, the garden has successfully conserved 1,700 species of plants away from their natural habitat, including 643 rare species and 337 species under key national protection. Thirty-six rare and endangered species have returned to the wild after years of conservation efforts. The construction of a national plant ex situ conservation center has been planned for the next three to five years to protect 95 percent of the rare and endangered plants in southern China.
