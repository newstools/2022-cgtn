Three people including the suspected gunman were killed and two others were seriously injured in a series of shootings early on Monday in British Columbia, Canada. Police said it's unclear what the suspect's motive was or whether the suspect and the victim knew each other, but the incidents seemed to be aimed at homeless people in the area.
