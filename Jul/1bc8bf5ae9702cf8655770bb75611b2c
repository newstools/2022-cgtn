Shanghai-based ZJ Biotech has received many urgent purchase orders from the World Health Organization (WHO) for its monkeypox virus test kit, and the company is now aiming to provide more support for accurate diagnosis and containment of the disease. The WHO on Saturday activated its highest alert level for the growing monkeypox outbreak, declaring the virus a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. The test kit developed by ZJ Biotech can accurately identify monkeypox virus by measuring the gene segment of the virus by specific fluorescence method. "Currently the best detection method for many infectious pathogens across the world is the nucleic acid test, which has an accuracy rate of over 95 percent. It can reach more than 99 percent for some individual diseases," said Shao Junbin, chairman of Shanghai ZJ Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. The monkeypox virus test kit manufactured by the company has been sent to 41 countries and regions around the world. Of these, 24 emergency orders from the WHO were sent to 21 countries, covering Africa, Europe, Oceania and Southeast Asia. At present, the company is in close contact with the WHO and health institutions in many countries around the world, aiming to provide support for accurate diagnosis and containment of the disease.
