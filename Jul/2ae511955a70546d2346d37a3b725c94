Chaba, the third typhoon of the year, made landfall in the coastal area of Maoming City in south China's Guangdong Province on Saturday afternoon. Meteorological authorities forecast strong winds and heavy downpours to lash the western part of the Pearl River Delta over the weekend. The typhoon was formed over the central and eastern areas of the South China Sea on Thursday. It is unclear the path the typhoon will take or the intensity of the rainfall it will cause but the National Defense General Office has sent two working groups to Guangdong Province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region to assist and guide typhoon prevention work.
