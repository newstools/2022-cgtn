Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, hailed the "historic and great achievement" made in the country's national defense and armed forces construction on Wednesday afternoon during a visit to an exhibition showcasing the army's progress over the years in Beijing. Xi went on calling for persistent efforts to provide "strategic support" for the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. His visit to the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution came just days ahead of the 95th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which is on August 1. The dream of building a strong army Since the 18th CPC National Congress in late 2012, the CPC Central Committee and the Central Military Commission have been leading the armed forces in enhancing their political loyalty, strengthening them through reform and technology and the training of competent personnel, running them in accordance with the law, and intensifying military training for better combat readiness, Xi said. The leaderships have also intensified military training for better combat readiness in realizing the Chinese dream of building a strong army, Xi noted. He also stressed persistent efforts to strive ahead with diligence to realize the goals set for the 100th anniversary of the founding of the PLA.
