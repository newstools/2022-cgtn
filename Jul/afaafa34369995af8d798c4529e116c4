The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command has recently organized a combined combat-readiness patrol and real-combat training exercises in the air and waters around the Taiwan region in response to recent U.S. support for "Taiwan independence" forces, according to a spokesperson for the command. "The U.S. has been frequently making provocative acts concerning the Taiwan question recently to embolden the 'Taiwan independence' forces," Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command said in a statement. "Those acts are futile and will only disturb peace across the Taiwan Straits and increase regional tension." "Taiwan is a part of China. The troops of the PLA Eastern Theater Command maintain high alert at all times, continuously strengthen training and war preparedness to firmly safeguard national sovereignty and security as well as regional peace and stability, and thwart any attempts for 'Taiwan Independence,'" he said. In late May, the PLA Eastern Theater Command conducted similar patrol and training exercises around Taiwan region. The Chinese Defense Ministry said the patrols were necessary measures to defend China's sovereignty and territorial integrity.
