Livestreaming is changing the way farmers sell their produce and it's raising their incomes too. A farmer's enterprise in northeastern Liaoning Province in particular has garnered subscribers from zero to 310,000 in a year, and made a fortune of 10 million yuan (about 1.49 million U.S. dollars) selling farm produce online boosted by livestreaming. His success has been prompting other small local businesses to follow suit. He's now eyeing 100 million yuan (about 14.91 million U.S. dollars) this year.
