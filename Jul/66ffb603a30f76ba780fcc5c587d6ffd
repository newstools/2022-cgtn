The Seattle Seahawks have reached a three-year, $72 million contract extension with their wide receiver DK Metcalf, ESPN reported on Thursday. The deal includes $58.2 million of guaranteed money and a $30 million signing bonus, which is the highest for anyone in his position. Having been drafted by the Seahawks with the 64th pick in 2019, Metcalf achieved 216 catches, 3,170 receiving yards and 29 touchdowns (TDs) in three seasons. He was named for both Pro-Bowl and Second-team All-Pro in 2020. Metcalf reported to the Seahawks' training camp on Monday but he didn't attend any sessions in the first two days. The team's head coach Pete Carroll revealed that Metcalf's absence was related to his extension negotiations. The WR skipped the team's mandatory minicamp in June. Prices for WRs skyrocketed during this offseason. The Miami Dolphins traded for Tyreek Hill with the Kansas City Chiefs and then signed him on a four-year, $120 million deal, the biggest for the position. The Las Vegas Raiders acquired Davante Adams from the Green Bay Packers and gave him a five-year, $141.25 million contract. Metcalf's average annual salary $24 million matched that the Buffalo Bills' Stefon Diggs to become the sixth-highest among receivers. It surpassed the $17.5 million of safety Jamal Adams as the top salary number of the Seahawks. The team began a complete rebuild after sending away quarterback Russell Wilson to the Denver Broncos and releasing linebacker Bobby Wagner.
