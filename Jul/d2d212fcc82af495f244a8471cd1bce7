Sudanese authorities have declared an overnight curfew in two towns in southeastern Blue Nile state bordering Ethiopia, after several days of tribal clashes had left 31 people dead and 39 injured. Clashes spread in several towns from Wednesday after the killing of a farmer, before security forces made arrests and brought the situation under control, according to a statement from the regional government on Saturday.
