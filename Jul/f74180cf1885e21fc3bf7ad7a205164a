Tesla has to date opened more than 1,200 Supercharger stations and more than 700 destination charging stations, covering over 370 cities and regions, on the Chinese mainland, the electric carmaker said on Sunday on China's Twitter-like Weibo. The company also said it has now offered over 8,700 Superchargers and over 1,800 destination chargers on the Chinese mainland, when it shared its second-quarter global production and delivery report. In the April to June period, Tesla produced 258,580 vehicles and delivered 254,695 vehicles, both higher than the figures in the second quarter of 2021, according to the company. In the second quarter of this year, the carmaker produced 242,169 Model 3 and Model Y cars and delivered 238,533 Model 3 and Model Y cars, compared with the production of 204,081 and the delivery of 199,360 vehicles in the second quarter of last year. Tesla produced 16,411 and delivered 16,162 Model S and Model X cars from April to June, nearly seven and eight times the figures in the same period last year respectively. However, it was the first quarterly decline in Tesla’s deliveries since the second quarter of 2020, and below 310,048 vehicles in the preceding quarter, as the latest COVID-19 resurgence in Shanghai forced Tesla to suspend production at its Shanghai Gigafactory for over 20 days. The carmaker said its Shanghai Gigafactory has returned to full production, which will help boost deliveries in the second half of the year. Tesla's Shanghai Gigafactory is the first wholly foreign-owned car manufacturing enterprise in China. Deliveries from the Shanghai Gigafactory stood at 484,130 vehicles last year, an increase of 235 percent from 2020 and accounting for 51.7 percent of Tesla's global production capacity in 2021.
