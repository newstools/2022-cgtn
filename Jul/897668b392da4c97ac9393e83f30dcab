China's auto sales regained strong momentum in June, boosted by the waning COVID-19 outbreaks and strong policy stimulus, industrial data showed Monday. A total of 2.5 million units of cars were sold in June, up 23.8 percent from one year earlier, data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers showed. Sales of passenger vehicles soared by 41.2 percent year on year to 2.22 million units, data showed. The sales of new energy vehicles jumped to 596,000 units in June, up 130 percent year on year. The sales of electric vehicles grew by 120 percent compared with the same period of last year. To resume car production and stabilize supply chain as the COVID-19 infections gradually waned, China has launched a series of favorable policies to boost the sales of automobiles. Last month, the country has decided to slash the purchase tax by half for passenger cars no more than 300,000 yuan ($44,800) with engine displacements within two liters purchased between June 1 and December 31 this year.
