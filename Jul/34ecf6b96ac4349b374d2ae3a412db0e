Former Italian Ambassador to China Alberto Bradanini graduated from the University of Rome La Sapienza in 1974 with a degree in political science. He launched his diplomatic career in 1975, holding various positions in Italy and abroad, including in Belgium, Venezuela, Norway and China. Bradanini has his own ideas about forms of democracy, and has asserted that "The debate over democracy is as old as the world… but beyond the meaning of the concept, we must be careful that the form also matches the substance." CGTN Global Stringer invited the former Italian ambassador to China to talk about his interpretation of democracy and its forms.
