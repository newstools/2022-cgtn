Tsultrim Nyima is a thangka artist. His home is in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai. These days, though, he's rarely in his studio. Instead, he's to be found outdoors, with a bucket of grass seeds in his hand. He's taking part in a project to restore the degraded grassland in the area. As he puts it; he's hoping to make the grassland of his homeland handsome again.
