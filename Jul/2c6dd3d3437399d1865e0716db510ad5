Diana Selic, a 45-year-old baker, is now struggling to restore her normal sense of taste and smell. Originally from Serbia, she has been living in France for 23 years and now owns a bakery in Lyon. In the summer of 2021, Selic contracted COVID-19 in Budva, Montenegro, leaving her with the aftermath of the loss of smell and an altered sense of taste. She still hasn't fully recovered. These symptoms have impeded her work as a baker and her ability to enjoy the foods she loves. "It's unbearable for me to not be able to smell," Selic said. She has been cooking all her life, but now she doesn't know how to do anything right. "There's not much that I can do except try to re-educate my brain, which is not an easy task." In this video, she tells CGTN global stringer about her struggles to accommodate this disturbing inability.
