China is highly concerned about the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act by the U.S. Congress, a spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said Friday, noting that the act "should be in compliance with WTO's relevant requirements." China will take measures to protect its legitimate rights and interests when necessary, added the spokesperson.
