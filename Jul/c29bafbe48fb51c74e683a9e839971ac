China's photovoltaic industry has rapidly developed in recent years, creating more jobs and helping reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Polysilicon is a key raw material in the solar photovoltaic supply chain. Leshan in Southwest China's Sichuan Province is the main base producing polysilicon for China and the world. The output value of the city's photovoltaic industry is expected to reach $30 billion by 2025.
