Germany remain on course for a ninth Women's European Championship title but were made to work hard for a 2-0 win over Austria to reach the semifinals of Euro 2022 on Thursday. Austria hit the woodwork three times in London, but goals from Lina Magull and Alexandra Popp sent the Germans through to meet France or the Netherlands in the semifinals. "The game could have ended 6-3," said Germany coach Martina Voss-Tecklenburg. "We played against a very good side. Huge compliments to Austria. I still believe that we leave the pitch as deserved winners," the coach added. Germany had cruised through what appeared to be the toughest group with convincing victories over Denmark, Spain and Finland to reach the last eight in style. But they were made to sweat until Popp's bizarre 90th minute goal, when she charged down Manuela Zinsberger's clearance, gave them side breathing space. "It was just as well that we took the lead in the first half," said Magull. "We were also a bit lucky because we gave them too many chances. We are incredibly happy and proud to have reached a semifinal again." Player of the Match: Klara Buhl (Germany) "Germany had difficulty breaking through Austria's defensive block, but the player who found creative openings again and again was Buhl. She was always a threat when she got the ball around the penalty box and she gave team-mates options, as well as creating space between Austria's strong defenders to fashion chances of her own," concluded the UEFA Technical Observer panel.
