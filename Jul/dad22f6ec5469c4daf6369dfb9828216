An unseasonal heat wave has set off wildfires that are scorching parts of Portugal, Spain and southern France. Residents in a small village in central Portugal had to flee from a fast-moving blaze that spread in less than an hour. At least 120 of the more than 600 evacuees required medical treatment, according to the Portuguese National Authority for Emergency and Civil Protection. More than 2,600 firefighters are combating flames nationwide with help from water-bombing aircraft and helicopters.
