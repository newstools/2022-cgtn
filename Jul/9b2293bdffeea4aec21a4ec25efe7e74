A part of the Cheng's Bagua Palm, the Bagua Spear is a renowned style of long-weapon Chinese martial arts. The spear moves in unison with the body – the spear head stabs as the shaft swings in sweeping motion. Yan Lili is the fifth-generation inheritor of the Cheng's Bagua Palm. She has been practicing wushu, Chinese martial arts, for over 40 years. She started as a child in the gymnastics team, selected by the wushu coach in the second or third grade of primary school.
