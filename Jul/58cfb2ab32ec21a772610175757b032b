China and Vietnam should joint hands in their development and make greater contributions to regional and global peace and prosperity, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Monday. Wang made the remarks during a meeting with Vietnamese Foreign Minister Bui Thanh Son in Bagan, Myanmar on the sidelines of the seventh Lancang-Mekong Cooperation Foreign Ministers' Meeting. With changes unseen in a century accelerating, various global challenges are emerging, Wang said. China and Vietnam are friendly socialist neighbors, emerging markets and important developing countries, he said, noting that the two sides share enormous common strategic interests. The two countries should maintain strategic communication, deepen strategic coordination and strive to build a community with a shared future, he said. The Vietnamese foreign minister said his country always regards its relations with China as a top priority in its diplomatic strategy. Vietnam is willing to maintain high-level exchanges and strategic communication with China and strive for new breakthroughs in their cooperation in various fields, he said. The two diplomats exchanged views on maritime issues and believed that the two sides should actively advance negotiations on the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea. They agreed that the two countries should properly handle disputes and promote maritime cooperation.
