Barcelona have announced their first signings of this summer transfer window after completing the free transfers of Chelsea defender Andreas Christensen and AC Milan midfielder Franck Kessie. The Spanish giants confirmed in a statement that Christensen and Kessie both have 500 million euros ($521.8 million) release clauses written into their new contracts and will be formally presented at a press conference on Thursday. Christensen had a successful 10-year stint at Chelsea, where he won the UEFA Champions League, Europa League, Club World Cup, Super Cup and the English FA Cup. But he has chosen to leave his boyhood club when his contract expires this summer. "I was a young boy at Chelsea with all the hopes and fears of a player starting his career. I'm grateful to the whole club for making my dream come true," said the 26-year-old Danish star on Instagram. "Having spent 10 amazing years at this club, I felt now was the right time for a new beginning for me and my family. Mentally the last few months have been tough as it's not been an easy decision to leave this club and the fans." Kessie enjoyed five brilliant seasons at AC Milan, during which the 25-year-old played a big part in driving the Italian powerhouse to their first league title in 11 years. He featured in 31 of 38 games under Milan boss Stefano Pioli last season and only missed out due to injury or international duties. According to several media outlets, Tottenham were also interested in signing Kessie and their managing director Fabio Paratici had set the indefatigable Cote d'Ivoire midfielder as the club's primary target, but Barcelona had the last laugh.
