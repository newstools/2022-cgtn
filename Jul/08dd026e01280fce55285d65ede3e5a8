Spain trained on Thursday ahead of their Group B opener against Finland at the Euro 2022 women's football championship on Friday. Jorge Vilda's team are looking to improve on what they already achieved at the Euros in 2017 where they lost in the quarter finals on a penalty shoot-out against Austria. Alexia Putellas' involvement is in doubt after she suffered a sprained knee just days before Spain's tournament opener. The 2021 Ballon d'Or Feminin winner has been capped exactly 100 times by La Furia Roja and she was expected to play a key role in her country's chances this summer. However, she could now miss the tournament after picking up an injury in training. Spain head coach Jorge Vilda said he has confidence in the 23 available players despite losing Putellas. "Alexia's (Putellas) injury it was a big blow, but I also would like to say that I fully trust the 23 remaining players ahead of tomorrow's match. We have several options with players that can fill up the gap. I think our football philosophy rests above any system or player because Spain plays in such a specific way. We have players that can do perfectly in that position on the pitch. "
