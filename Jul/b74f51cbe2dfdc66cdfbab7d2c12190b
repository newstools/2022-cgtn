John Lee was sworn in by Chinese President Xi Jinping as the sixth-term chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday morning, as Hong Kong marked the 25th anniversary of its return to China. In his speech, Lee expressed his gratitude to the Central Government and vowed to build "a more caring and inclusive Hong Kong filled with vibrancy, hope and development opportunities." He said, Hong Kong enjoys unique advantages under "One Country, Two Systems" as a special administrative region, making it possible for Hong Kong to fully integrate into the country's national development, to thrive as a metropolitan city with high international connectivity, and to serve as the most effective gateway between the country and the world. Lee called on Hong Kong residents to join hands for a brighter future. "Together, we will start a new chapter for building a better Hong Kong, contribute to the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and contribute to the realization of  the Chinese dream of national rejuvenation."
