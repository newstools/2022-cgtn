Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan on Tuesday met with his Iranian counterpart Ebrahim Raisi at the Sa'dabad Historical-Cultural Complex in Tehran. Erdogan, who arrived in Iran earlier on the day for an official visit to the country, has also met Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Speaking at a joint press conference, Raisi called Erdogan's visit "an important turning point in the relations between the two countries." Raisi said both Iran and Türkiye have extended the gas supply contract between the two countries and it is possible to increase the volume of trade exchange to $30 billion.
