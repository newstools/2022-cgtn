China successfully launched two new satellites from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north China's Shanxi Province at 6:57 a.m. (BJT) on Saturday. The satellites, Siwei 03 and 04, were launched by a Long March-2C carrier rocket and have entered the planned orbit. They will provide commercial remote sensing data services in fields such as surveying and mapping, environmental protection, urban security and digital rural development.
