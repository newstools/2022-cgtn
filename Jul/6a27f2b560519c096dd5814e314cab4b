At least 26 people, including children, have died in floods unleashed by torrential rain in eastern Kentucky, and more fatalities are expected, the U.S. state's governor, Andy Beshear, said on Sunday. "Our death toll has risen to 26 lost – and that number will increase. There is widespread damage with many families displaced and more rain expected throughout the next day," the governor wrote on Twitter early on Sunday.
