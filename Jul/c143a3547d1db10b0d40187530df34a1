Stephen Innes, the chief global market strategist at AxiCorp, speaks to Global Business about Janet Yellen's visit to Seoul, South Korea. Innes tells CGTN's Guan Xin that a price cap on Russian oil exports, which Yellen is expected to push for, could drive prices up because there is going to be less oil supply in the market. He adds that the U.S. Federal Reserve has been extremely hawkish about raising interest rate, and this is creating recessionary risks around the world.
