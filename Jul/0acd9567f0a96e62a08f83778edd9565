Sirens warning of incoming rocket fire sounded in the southern Israeli city of Ashkelon and the area near Gaza early on Saturday, the Israeli military said. A military statement said two rockets were fired from Gaza toward Israel, adding that one was intercepted and the other hit an open area. No group has claimed responsibility for the launches yet.
