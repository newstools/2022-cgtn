At least six people were killed and more than 10 others were injured when a passenger bus collided with a car in Pakistan's eastern Punjab province, officials said on Saturday. The accident took place on Shakargarh Road in the Narowal district of the province when the bus driver lost control of the vehicle while overtaking and hit the car, district police officer Narowal Rizwan Omer Gondal told Xinhua. All those killed were in the car while 10 people on the bus were injured, the official said, adding that the accident occurred due to speeding and slippery road conditions owing to a recent heavy downpour in the district.
