China's Qieyang Shijie clinched her second bronze medal at the 2022 World Athletics Championships after finishing third in the inaugural women's 35km race walk at Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Oregon, on Friday. The 31-year-old continued her fine run of form as she crossed the finish line in a time of 2:40:37 to set a new Asian record.  Peru's Kimberly Garcia Leon won the title in 2:39:16 and Poland's Katarzyna Zdzieblo bagged silver in 2:40:03. The result of the 35km race walk discipline, which replaces the old 50km at the worlds, means that all three athletes mirrored their finishes in the 20km race walk last week.  Garcia Leon became the first athlete to win both race walking golds at a major tournament since Robert Korzeniowski pocketed the men's 20km and 50km events at the Sydney Olympics in 2000. "I have always dreamed of making history in a sport I am so passionate about, that I have been practicing since I was five," Garcia Leon told reporters. "After my 20km win, I tried to stay well hydrated, to eat well to get ready for the 35km. I trained to finish strong in the last 5km." Qieyang Shijie, meanwhile, reflected with satisfaction after securing her fourth medal at the worlds. "I give myself a perfect score for my performance today and I feel really great," she beamed. Later in the day, Tokyo Olympic champion Liu Shiying struggled to maintain her high standards, finishing fourth in the women's javelin throw final.  Australia's Kelsey-Lee Barber, who threw a majestic 66.91m in her third attempt, won gold. American Kara Winger claimed silver and Japan's Haruka Kitaguchi completed the podium.
