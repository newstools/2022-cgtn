In the U.S., dozens of former Republican and Democratic officials are pushing for the formation of a new national political party. Reuters is reporting that the new party, called "Forward," aims to appeal to millions of voters they say are disillusioned with America's two-party system. "Forward" will be co-chaired by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang and the former Republican governor of New Jersey, Christine Todd Whitman.
