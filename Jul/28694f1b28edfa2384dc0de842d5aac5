Recently the euro fell below parity with the U.S. dollar, the first time since 2002. The euro's epic fall against the dollar is closely linked to the energy crisis Europe has been experiencing since the start of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Western sanctions against Russia have hit Europe's energy supply hard and caused stagflation and risks of recession. As CGTN's Guan Xin explains, the fall of the currency should sound the alarm for Europe: that it is paying more for direct conflict with Russia and blindly following the U.S. to fuel the flames is not in its fundamental interest.
