Chinese and Indonesian leaders have set the general direction of building a community with a shared future for their relations – the most important political outcome reached during Indonesian President Joko Widodo's visit to Beijing this week, Chinese Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Jianghao said on Tuesday. Wu made the remarks during a press briefing about Chinese President Xi Jinping's meeting with Widodo earlier in the day. The two leaders agreed to continue to promote the four-pillar cooperation in politics, economy, people-to-people exchanges and maritime projects, Wu said.
