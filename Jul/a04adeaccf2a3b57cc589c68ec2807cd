At least five people have been killed and about 50 wounded during anti-UN protests in the eastern DR Congo city of Goma, government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Tuesday. Demonstrations against the perceived ineffectiveness of the UN peacekeeping operation MONUSCO erupted on Monday, and turned violent when protesters stormed the mission's local headquarters and a logistical base.
