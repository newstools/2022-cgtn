Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday said Hong Kong thrives when the young people thrive and called on them to join the efforts to build a better Hong Kong. Xi made the remarks when he delivered a speech at a ceremony celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the inauguration of the sixth-term government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. "We should give care and love to the young people," he said. "When the young people thrive, Hong Kong thrives. When the young people grow, Hong Kong grows. When there is a future for the young people, there is a future for Hong Kong." The Chinese president said efforts should be made to guide the youth to learn about the national and global development trends to strengthen their sense of national pride, and to create more opportunities for them to grow and shine.
