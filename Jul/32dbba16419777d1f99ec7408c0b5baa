China intends to contribute $50 million to the financial intermediary fund which has been approved by the World Bank for Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response (PPR), China's Minister of Finance Liu Kun said at a gathering of G20 finance officials held on July 15 and 16. Liu said G20 members should continue to maintain the G20's position as the premier forum for international economic cooperation, coordinate pandemic prevention and control with economic and social development, safeguard the security and stability of the global industrial and supply chains, and prevent serious negative spillovers from the policy adjustments of some countries. China supports G20 financial channels to conduct exchanges and sharing on policies in terms of climate change, and maintains the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities, Liu said. He stressed that China is willing to work with all parties to achieve high-standard, people-friendly and sustainable infrastructure investment.
