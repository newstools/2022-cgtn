Tianzhou-3, a cargo spacecraft that carried supplies to China's space station, made a controlled re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere at 11:31 a.m. on Wednesday (Beijing Time), according to the China Manned Space Agency. The Long March-7 Y4 rocket carrying the Tianzhou-3 blasted off at 3:10 p.m. (BJT) on September 20, 2021, from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's Hainan Province. It carried about six tonnes of goods, including food items and spacesuits, to the country's under-construction space station. Six and a half hours later, the cargo spacecraft docked with core module Tianhe at 10:08 p.m. (BJT) on the same day. The Tianzhou-3 separated from the space station core module Tianhe on July 17, 2022, after completing all assigned assembly tasks. It is the third mission of China's Tianzhou-class unmanned cargo spacecraft and the second resupply mission to the space station after Tianzhou-2.
