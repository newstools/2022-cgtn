Inflation in South Africa surged to its highest level in 13 years in June, driven primarily by rising prices of food, transport and housing, official data showed on Wednesday. "Annual consumer price inflation was 7.4 percent in June 2022, up from 6.5 percent in May, and the highest rate since May 2009," the statistics agency, StatsSA, said in a statement.
