An injured upland buzzard was found in the yard of a police station in Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous, as if it was coming to seek help. Police officers checked the bird of prey and found its wings were hurt. They fed the bird with some food and water, and sent it to local forestry department for further treatment.
