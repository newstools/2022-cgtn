Insurgents believed to be from the Allied Democratic Forces, a Ugandan armed group that has operated in the dense forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) for decades, attacked a church clinic at around 10:00 p.m. local time on Thursday, witnesses told Reuters. An army spokesperson confirmed the attack in the town of Lume in North Kivu province, but did not say how many people died.
