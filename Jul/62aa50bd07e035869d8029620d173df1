The Standing Committee of the Shanghai National People's Congress clearly stipulates that no employer shall terminate the labor contract due to a worker suffering from an infectious disease and shall not refuse to hire a worker on the grounds of an infectious disease. This decision is related to the recent employment scenario in Shanghai. This year, due to the impact of COVID-19, the city's employment has faced unprecedented challenges. The average urban unemployment rate reached 12.5% in the second quarter. At the same time, according to various municipal departments, there has been a surge in demand for employment, and fresh graduates are facing difficulties in finding a job. The contradictions between enterprises and labor disputes have also increased significantly. In view of this, it is necessary to formulate and issue decisions on relevant legal issues, and the priority of stabilizing and increasing employment opportunities has been emphasized. For the employment of key groups, such as fresh college graduates, the government supports independent entrepreneurship and flexible employment. The decision also specifies requirements for fair employment and dispute resolution. Make it clear that no employer shall terminate the labor contract or fire employees because of infectious disease, except as otherwise provided by laws and administrative regulations.
