All parties should draw lessons from the Ukraine crisis, said Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Sunday during a phone conversation with Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto. Szijjarto, who requested the call, outlined the current situation in Europe and Hungary, especially the economic and financial challenges faced by Hungary due to the spillover of the Ukraine crisis. He said Hungary is pleased with the achievements resulting from cooperation with China in various fields, especially the smooth progress of trade and investment cooperation. Noting that the crisis in Ukraine has not only had a severe impact on Europe, but also had negative spillover effects around the world, Wang said that China has committed itself to promoting peace negotiations even though the country is not a party to the Ukraine crisis.On China-Hungary relations, he said that China is ready to work with Hungary to build bilateral relations into a model of more mature and mutual-trust state-to-state relations, adding that the country will continue to pursue a friendly policy toward Hungary and support Chinese enterprises to invest in Hungary. He also called on Hungary to work to push the EU to adopt a positive and pragmatic policy towards China. Szijjarto said that China has never been a rival to Europe, but a partner that offers opportunities for cooperation. Hungary will remain committed to promoting EU-China cooperation based on mutual respect, fairness and mutual benefit, he added.
