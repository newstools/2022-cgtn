Hong Kong has acted as an important bridge and window connecting the Chinese mainland with other parts of the world since its return to the motherland, and made irreplaceable contributions to the miracle of China's long-term, stable and rapid economic development, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Friday. Xi made the remarks at the meeting celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the inaugural ceremony of the sixth-term government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Over the past 25 years, the practice of "One Country, Two Systems" policy has achieved universally recognized success in Hong Kong, Xi said. The region has weathered all kinds of challenges and moved forward steadily, he said, adding that none of the challenges has stopped Hong Kong's progress. Hong Kong's economy has grown vigorously, maintaining a solid status as international financial, shipping and trade center, with rapid rise of innovative technology industries, world-leading freedom and openness and world-class business environment, he noted.
