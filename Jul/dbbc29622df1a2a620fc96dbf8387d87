China drew against South Korea in their second game at the East Asian Football Championship women's tournament in Japan on Saturday. South Korea scored first at the 34th minute but China tied the score at the 76th minute ending as a draw. Having finished their first two games with one win (2-0 over Chinese Taipei) and one draw, China will play against Japan which holds two wins, on July 26. China will need to win that game to bring home the championship trophy. China and South Korea faced each other in the Asian Football Confederation Women's Asian Cup final in February when the former overcame a two-goal deficit to secure victory. South Korean players had expressed a strong will to get vengeance before Saturday's game. They showed great aggressiveness from the beginning and pressured China hard from the midfield. Chinese players apparently were not ready for this and fell into an unfavorable situation early. At the 34th minute, Choe Yu-ri caught China's goalkeeper Zhu Yu off guard with a sudden long shot, placing South Korea in the lead. China's manager Shui Qingxia sent Zhang Rui and Xiao Yuyi to the field after the halftime break to enhance the team's offense. As the team began to progress and gained back control of the game, China's ace forward Wang Shuang replaced Zhang Linyan at the 64th minute. This was Wang's first appearance in any formal international game in almost six months after suffering injuries at the Asian Cup. It didn't take Wang long to make a change for China. Her passing via the corner kick from the right at the 76th minute caused chaos in South Korea's box. Wang Linlin exploited the opportunity to score and tie the game 1-1 for China. China extended their unbeaten record over South Korea to nine straight games after Saturday night.
