A fourth person has been rescued after a floating crane sank off the coast of southern China's Guangdong Province. Twenty-six people are still missing. Authorities in Guangdong and Hong Kong have been coordinating rescue operations, deploying dozens of vessels and 14 aircraft in the area. The crane's anchor chain broke when Typhoon Chaba hit the vessel on July 2, resulting in the crane sinking. CGTN's reporter Cao Chufeng has more details in the city of Guangzhou.
