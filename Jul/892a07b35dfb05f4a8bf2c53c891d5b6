South Korea's Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy announced on Tuesday that it will increase nuclear power's contribution to the national energy mix to 30% or more by 2030. President Yoon Suk-yeol has rejected the idea of phasing out nuclear energy, and made it a key pledge of his campaign to boost investment in the industry and revive its status as a key exporter of lean and safe reactors.
