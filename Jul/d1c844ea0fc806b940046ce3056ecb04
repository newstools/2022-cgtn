Tesla says its deliveries of electric vehicles fell in the second quarter, mainly due to a weeks-long closure of its factory in China. The company delivered more than 250,000 vehicles from April to June, down 18 percent from the first quarter of 2022. This is the first such decline in more than two years. Parts shortages and anti-COVID measures at Tesla's plant in Shanghai caused a big drop in the EV giant's latest global vehicle deliveries.
