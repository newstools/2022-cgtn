Serbian goalkeeper Mile Svilar said on Saturday that he is thrilled to join Roma and Jose Mourinho after signing a five-year contract with the Italian club. "To be honest, in my wildest dreams, I could not have imagined to be working with him," said Svilar of Mourinho during his presentation on Saturday. Twenty-two-year-old Svilar, who was born in Belgium to Serbian parents, joined Roma after playing for Benfica B in the last three seasons. In 2017, he was signed by Benfica's first team, becoming the youngest ever goalkeeper to play for the Portuguese side. (With input from AP)
