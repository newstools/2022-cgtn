The Sakurajima volcano on western Japan's island of Kyushu erupted on Sunday, according to Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). The JMA has raised the volcanic warning to the highest tier of level 5, ordering evacuation in the residential area. Japan's nuclear regulators said no irregularities had been detected at the Sendai nuclear power plant after the nearby volcano erupted. The nuclear facility is located some 50 km northwest of Sakurajima. At around 10:00 p.m or two hours after the eruption, a Japanese government spokesperson told reporters the government had not heard of any damage from the eruption. (With input from Reuters)
