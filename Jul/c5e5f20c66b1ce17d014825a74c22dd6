Sri Lankan police have arrested nine people after a raid on an anti-government protest camp in the capital Colombo on Friday. They dismantled the camp and evicted activists gathered outside the president's office. The raid comes a day after veteran politician Ranil Wickremesinghe, who vowed tough action against demonstrators, was sworn in as the crisis-hit country's new president.
