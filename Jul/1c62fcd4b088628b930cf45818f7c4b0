Mark Magsayo will defend his WBC featherweight title on Saturday against Rey Vargas at the Alamodome in San Antonio. The 27-year-old undefeated Filipino boxer (24-0, 16 knockouts) won his belt on a mixed decision over Gary Russell Jr. back in January. Vargas, a 31-year-old Mexican pugilist, is similarly unbeaten after building a 35-0 career with 22 knockouts. He previously held the WBC super bantamweight belt before changing weight classes. Vargas last fought in November, beating Leonardo Baez by unanimous decision. (With input from AP)
