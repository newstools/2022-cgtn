With the title "Great to Meet You," China Media Group's (CMG) China-Africa Youth Video Contest was officially launched online this Monday. The contest is co-organized by CMG and the College of Media and International Culture at Zhejiang University. The contest aims to use short video creation to build a bridge of exchange and mutual appreciation between Chinese and African youth, promote cultural exchanges, foster mutual understanding, and develop long-lasting friendly ties between the two peoples in the future. The 2022 African Youth Survey revealed that the majority of African youth believe that China has become the country with the most positive influence on Africa. CMG has always paid attention to the development and changes in Africa and insists on using new technology combined with excellent content to attract the participation of young African groups and provide them with a platform to enhance their abilities and show their ambitions. The launch of the China-Africa Youth Video Contest will bring the latest trend in the field of short video creation between two countries; it will encourage young people to record "China in your eyes" and "Africa in your eyes" and express their interpretation of "China-Africa exchange" and "youth power" with personalized perspectives. The contest will run from July to September. Experts will select the first, second and third prize recipients as well as the "Outstanding Work" award winners. The entry videos will have the opportunity to be featured on CMG and mainstream media platforms in Africa.
