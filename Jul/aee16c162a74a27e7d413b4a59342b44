The James Webb Space Telescope, the most powerful observatory to be placed in orbit, has revealed the clearest infrared image of the early universe, dating back 13 billion years. The first image was revealed in a White House briefing by President Joe Biden on Monday. The image unveiled at the White House will be followed on Tuesday by the release of four more galactic beauty shots from the giant space telescope.
