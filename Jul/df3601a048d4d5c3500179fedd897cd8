The NBA generated more basketball-related income than ever this past season, the total number coming up just short of $9 billion. Nikola Jokic agreed to the biggest contract in NBA history. Bradley Beal agreed to a deal worth a quarter-billion dollars, and the money just kept flowing. Shortly after midnight Friday in the Eastern time zone, three more players, Karl-Anthony Towns, Devin Booker and Ja Morant, also agreed to huge-money extensions. Jokic agreed to a supermax extension to remain with the Denver Nuggets, the two-time reigning MVP guaranteeing himself at least $264 million over five seasons starting with the 2023-24 campaign. The final number may go up slightly depending on what the league’s salary cap is going into the 2023-24 season and if it exceeds current projections. Those five players, Jokic, Beal, Towns, Booker and Morant, had more than $1.1 billion in money committed to them in their new deals, highlighting the moves made Thursday when the NBA’s annual free-agent negotiating window opened.
