This video shows how south China's Hainan Province looks like from space. It was filmed by the Shenzhou-14 crew when the Tianhe core module was passing over the island, 10 minutes before the Wentian lab module was launched into space. China successfully launched its space station lab module Wentian, the largest spacecraft ever developed by the country, into orbit on July 24. The perfectly executed long-anticipated mission marked a milestone in China's aerospace industry history.
