On July 13, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa authorized Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to carry out presidential duties, said the speaker of parliament. Protesters stormed the Sri Lankan prime minister's office after the president fled the country only hours before he was to step down amid a devastating economic crisis. In recent days, protesters have occupied several government buildings, demanding their top leaders to step down.
