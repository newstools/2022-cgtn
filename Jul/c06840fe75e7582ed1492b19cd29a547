James Harden displayed a clear will to fight for an NBA Championship ring by taking a $14-million pay cut when he agreed to a new two-year, $68.6 million extension with the Philadelphia 76ers. His sacrifice enabled the team to sign P.J. Tucker, a tough defender, and Danuel House, an energetic wing option. Meanwhile, the 76ers acquired De'Anthony Melton, a sharp dagger off the bench, via trade with the Memphis Grizzlies. The new arrivals will surely make Philly a better franchise. If Tyrese Maxey continues to grow, the 76ers can become even better on the offensive end. Of course, as the team's star duo, Joel Embiid and Harden will play the most important roles on the team. Embiid is likely to continue his MVP-caliber performance from last season, if he stays healthy. Harden already did the best a playmaker could do in the 2021-22 campaign, but he may need to bring back more of the aggressive scorer he used to be.
