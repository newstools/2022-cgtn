Nyanpo Yuzee in Jigzhi County, Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, used to be a vast and beautiful expanse of grassland. However, over the past 20 years, the grassland has been degrading rapidly due to various reasons, including over grazing and climate change. The local herders regard the grassland as their mother, and they are now trying to restore her through a mass grass-planting campaign.
