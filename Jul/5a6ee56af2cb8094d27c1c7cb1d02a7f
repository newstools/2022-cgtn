A military drill has been conducted by the Chinese navy on the Yellow Sea to practice landing aircraft safely on a ship at any time. The drill consisted of daytime and nighttime operations, in which pilots had to correctly assess flight height, speed, direction and distance. Meanwhile, they need to monitor the ship's route, and cooperate with crew members under the command of the control tower to land on the deck safely. Nighttime landing operations were more challenging and dangerous for pilots as they flew helicopters in darkness above the sea, with only lights on the ship as reference signs. During the drill, pilots completed nearly 300 landings on the deck.
