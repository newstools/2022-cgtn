Beijing's Olympic Forest Park is a Mecca for runners. Built as a supporting project for the 2008 Summer Olympics, its 680 hectares of nature gardens include landscaped hills, forests, lakes, and many kilometers of running track. That makes it an ideal location for residents of the capital to exercise; escaping the stress of city life in beautiful surroundings. In this episode we meet some of the many thousands of runners who come here every week, and talk to them about how this form of exercise has changed their lives.
