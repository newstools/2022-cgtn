Chelsea and Manchester City have reached an agreement over the transfer of Raheem Sterling which will take the 27-year-old English striker to Stamford Bridge for 47.5 million pounds (about $57.1 million), according to Sky Sports. Sterling will undergo a medical for Chelsea in the coming days to complete the deal soon enough for him to join the club on the pre-season tour in the U.S.. He has already agreed to a five-year contract, that contains a clause for a one-year extension, with the Blues. Sterling was acquired by City in 2015 from Liverpool for around 44 million pounds upfront. He made 339 appearances in which he scored 131 goals and created 95 assists for City, and won four Premier League titles and one FA Cup with the Manchester club. Chelsea finished the 2021-22 season winning nothing and ranking third in the Premier League table, 19 points behind the champions City. They watched a series of key members leave after the season ended, including Antonio Rudiger for Real Madrid and Romelu Lukaku for Inter Milan (on loan). More may be on their way out of Stamford Bridge, which means Chelsea have more positions to fill in. They are currently negotiating with City over the transfer of Nathan Ake. The Dutch center-back cost City 40 million pounds from Bournemouth in 2020, but saw his appearances cut to 14 games in the Premier League. Chelsea were also interested in signing Matthijs de Ligt from Juventus, but they may be outbid by Bayern Munich which offered up to 90 million euros (about $91.6 million) for him. Sterling is likely to become the second striker City sold this summer after sending Gabriel Jesus to Arsenal for 45 million pounds.
