Linda Sembrant's stoppage time winner broke Belgian hearts as Sweden won 1-0 in the English town of Leigh on Friday to set up a Euro 2022 semifinal with hosts England. The Olympic silver medalists were strong favorites to progress against a Belgian side playing in their first knockout game at a major women's tournament. However, the number two-ranked side in the world were frustrated by Belgium goalkeeper Nicky Evrard, poor finishing and a controversial VAR review for 92 minutes until Sembrant made the breakthrough. "I think it's a game where we were in control," said Sembrant. "They made it really hard because they made it very tight in front of the goal, but in the end, we got that goal that we needed." Sweden's preparations had been hit by a trio of positive coronavirus cases for Jonna Andersson, Hanna Glas and Emma Kullberg. But they still dominated from start to finish with 34 attempts to Belgium's three. The Belgians had surpassed expectations just by making it through the group stages for the first time in only their second major tournament in the women's game. "We were the underdogs from the beginning but we did really well as a team," said the Red Flames' captain Tessa Wullaert. "That's what I want to remember from this tournament." "I felt the tears coming because I was so happy," said Sweden defender Magdalena Eriksson. "It was a frustrating evening. To finally get that relief, oh my God. I'm so proud of all the girls for how hard we fought." Sweden have not lost in open play since March 2020. But they face a huge step up in quality against England in front of a 30,000 capacity crowd in Sheffield on Tuesday. "I know all the players, extremely talented players," added Chelsea defender Eriksson. "England have been amazing in the tournament so far. We have to be really on it. It's about recovering and getting fresh again."
