Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Wednesday called on all parties in the world to make efforts to protect international laws as "the world is evolving in a complicated manner." He made the remarks during a meeting with his Vietnamese counterpart Bui Thanh Son in capital Hanoi. Lavrov is on a two-day visit to Vietnam before heading to a G20 meeting later this week in Indonesia. (With input from Reuters)
