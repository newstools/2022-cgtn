The 2022 World Athletics Championships will get underway in the U.S. city of Eugene, Oregon on Saturday and will run through until July 25. China's delegation of 53 athletes, who will compete across 23 events, has already arrived. Among them is Asia's fastest man Su Bingtian, who will be looking to improve on his career-best 100 meters showing from the Tokyo Olympics last year. The women's side features a few reigning Olympic champions. Shot putter Gong Lijao, javelin thrower Liu Shiying and race walker Liu Hong will all be hoping to add to their success in Japan in 2021.
