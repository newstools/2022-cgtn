Four people were killed and three others are in critical condition on Thursday following a car crash involving an alleged migrant smuggling operation in Texas, according to the state's Department of Public Safety. "The driver suspected of human smuggling evaded law enforcement and crashed into a commercial vehicle," local police said. The incident comes three days after 53 migrants being smuggled into the U.S. were found dead inside a tractor-trailer in San Antonio.
