Left tackle (LT) Orlando Brown Jr. of the Kansas City Chiefs has turned down the team's long-term contract extension offer and will play under the franchise tag in the new season, according to ESPN. The Chiefs had set Friday as the deadline to reach a long-term deal with Brown Jr. on their final offer of a six-year, $139 million contract, including a $30.25 million signing bonus and a salary of $95 million in the first five years. Instead, Brown Jr. will earn $16.7 million while playing for the Chiefs in the 2022 season. ESPN revealed that the player and the team remain hopeful of clinching a new contract after the season. Brown Jr. has already skipped voluntary workouts and the Chiefs' mandatory minicamp. He can continue to do so during the team's training camp as long as he hasn't inked a contract. "He's a young guy, so there's plenty of room to grow," Andy Reid, head coach of the team, said. "He's wired the right way to do that, to attack that. I know he's been working out and doing the things he needs to do to get ready for camp. He's a young guy that's new to the position, is on the rise, I would hope." Having been traded by the Baltimore Ravens to the Chiefs to play his fourth NFL season in 2021, Brown Jr. was selected for Pro Bowl for the third straight time. It cost the Chiefs four draft picks, including a first-rounder. They understandably wanted to keep him for years to come. "We love Orlando here. He's a good human being, and he's a good professional," Reid said. "He's grown up around it. I think he's got good counsel. So, we just have to work through it."
