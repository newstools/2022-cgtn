Chinese President Xi Jinping, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, sent a congratulatory letter on Thursday to the CPC and World Marxist Political Parties Forum. Marxism is an open theory that is constantly developing, Xi said, adding that with the efforts of world Marxist political parties, it is radiating new vigor and vitality in the 21st century. The CPC continues to integrate the basic principles of Marxism with China's actual conditions and fine traditional Chinese culture, continues to adapt Marxism to the Chinese context and unswervingly advance along the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics, he said. It is the common responsibility of Marxist political parties to promote the localization and modernization of Marxism to illuminate the road ahead of mankind with the light of truth, he said. The CPC is ready to strengthen exchanges and dialogue with world Marxist political parties to enrich and develop Marxism, he added. The forum was sponsored by the International Department of the CPC Central Committee.
