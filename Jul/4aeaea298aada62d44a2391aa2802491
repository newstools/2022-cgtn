U.S. President Joe Biden said in a letter to Congress on Wednesday that he will officially cancel Afghanistan's designation as a major non-NATO ally, CNN has reported. The United States designated Afghanistan in 2012, making it eligible for military training and assistance, including accelerated sales and leasing of military equipment, even after NATO forces left the country.
