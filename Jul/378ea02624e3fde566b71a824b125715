A total of 88 nanotechnology innovation products were unveiled on Sunday at a forum titled "25 Chinese Nano Academicians" in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province. The products have been developed as part of the agenda of "development plan of nano-industry innovation highland in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and development plan of nano-industry in China." The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area is now home to more than 10,000 nanotechnology-related industries and enterprises, forming a large-scale nano-industry base and creating a good nano-industrialization innovation environment, said Zhao Yuliang, director-general of National Center for Nanoscience and Technology of China and academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. The products unveiled at the forum include world-leading tumor treatment nano-robots, 5G wave filter, quantum dot optical diffuser plate that leads the research field of liquid crystal ultra-clear display, pure inorganic nano-coating used in power battery thermal control protection, diffraction waveguide display device and the luminescent rare-earth based nano-materials used in modern agriculture. A group signing ceremony for the Greater Bay Area nano-industry alliance strategic cooperation was also held during the event. The cooperation will cover a wide range of areas, from new material and bio-medicine to finance, for the co-prosperity of nanotechnology enterprises in the Greater Bay Area.
