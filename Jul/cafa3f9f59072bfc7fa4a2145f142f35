A week of clashes between rival gangs in the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince has left at least 89 people dead and dozens injured, the National Human Rights Defense Network claimed on Wednesday. The fresh violence, coupled with soaring food prices and fuel shortages, has compounded the brutal downward spiral in the city's security situation. The violence erupted on July 7 between two rival factions in Cité Soleil, an impoverished and densely populated neighborhood of Port-au-Prince. "At least 89 people were killed and 16 others are missing," the rights group said in a statement, adding that another 74 people sustained gunshot or knife wounds. International humanitarian organizations have struggled to deliver vital food supplies and to provide medical care to victims in the affected areas.
