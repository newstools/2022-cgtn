Indian star Pusarla V. Sindhu defeated China's Wang Zhiyi 21-9 11-21 21-15 in the final of the Singapore Open on Sunday, her third title this season. Double Olympic medalist Sindhu got off a great start, but Wang came back to win the second set by a thumping margin. Sindhu, 27, managed to stay strong in the key moments to win the decider against the 22-year-old Wang, the reigning Asian Championships gold medalist. "She was very aggressive and fast in speed in the later half of the third set, and I didn't deal with it well," Wang said after the match. But the Chinese shuttler said she had been making progress and recovered after suffering lows in recent weeks, having lost to South Korea's Sim Yu-jin in a thriller at Uber Cup in May. Wang, who is currently ranking World No.11, is a rising star who has delivered some stellar performances this season. She is likely to move into the world's top 10, making her the second highest ranked Chinese female shuttler. Meanwhile, China's mixed doubles pair Wang YiLyu and Huang Dongping took the silver medal as they were defeated by the top seeds, Thailand's Dechapol Puavaranukroh and Sapsiree Taerattanachai, 21-12, 21-17.
