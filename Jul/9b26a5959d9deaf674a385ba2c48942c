Eighty-four people were confirmed dead between July 8-10 in the heat wave that is scorching Spain, the Carlos III Health Institute, which reports to the Spanish Ministry of Health, said on Friday.All the deaths were attributed to the heat exceeding 40 degrees Celsius in large parts of the country. Temperatures even rose above 45 degrees Centigrade in southern and southwestern parts of the country, which has pushed up costs for residents. "Families have to be frugal when using air conditioners and electric fans because electricity bills have surged," said Alberto, a resident in Madrid."We are forced to reduce our air conditioner usage. Once the room is cool, we turn it off," said Angelina, another resident of the capital.The heat wave is expected to continue into next week, sparking fears of more deaths. This is the second major heat wave of the year in Spain. The first one lasted from June 11 to 20 and claimed the lives of 829 people nationwide, the Ministry of Health said. Back then, temperatures peaked at 44.5 degrees Celsius.The authorities recommend that people drink plenty of water, refrain from excessive exercise and stay indoors as much as possible. Heat waves can cause heat strokes and aggravate existing health problems. Across western Europe, new records have been set as temperatures topped 40 degrees Celsius across much of Spain and Portugal Wednesday. In the meantime, wildfires blistered land in France, Spain and Portugal on Friday forcing hundreds of residents to evacuate. (Cover images via VCG)
