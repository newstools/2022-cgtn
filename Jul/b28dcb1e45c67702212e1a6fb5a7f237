Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Monday that China is ready to work with countries around the world to promote more robust, greener and healthier global development. Xi made the remarks in a congratulatory letter to a forum on global development held in Beijing on Monday. The world is facing drastic changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, and the global economic recovery is weak and sluggish, Xi said. The development gap between the North and the South is widening, and the world has entered a new period of turbulence and changes, he said, adding that promoting global development has become a major subject faced by mankind. Therefore, China proposed the Global Development Initiative (GDI), he said. China is ready to make joint efforts with countries around the world to follow a people-centered approach, stay committed to benefits for all, and prioritize development on the international agenda, he said. He stressed China's readiness to work with other countries in promoting innovation-driven development and harmony between man and nature, accelerating the implementation of the United Nations' 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and pursuing more robust, greener and healthier global development. The GDI was put forward by the Chinese president in September last year at the general debate of the 76th session of the UN General Assembly. (Cover: Photo taken on November 22, 2021 shows wind turbines of the De Aar wind power project invested by China's Longyuan Power and its South African partners in De Aar, South Africa. /Xinhua)
