The Shenzhen-Zhongshan Bridge is a 24-kilometer-long cross-sea cluster project, including a 17-kilometer bridge section, that integrates "bridges, islands, tunnels and underwater communication." The bridge will connect Shenzhen City and Zhongshan City in south China's Guangdong Province, drastically reducing commuting time from more than two hours to 30 minutes. According to the project's construction officials, it will actively promote the agglomeration of industrial chains, economies and cultures throughout the area.
