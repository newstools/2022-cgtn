China will stay committed to the fundamental national policy of opening-up and will work with all parties to intensify dialogue and communication to enable mutually beneficial win-win cooperation, Premier Li Keqiang said on Tuesday during a virtual meeting with World Economic Forum (WEF) Executive Chairman Klaus Schwab. Li added cooperation between China and the WEF has traversed a journey of over four decades, almost in tandem with China's reform and opening-up process. He pointed out that world development currently faces many uncertainties and destabilizing factors. However, world peace and development, and interaction and exchanges between countries are a shared wish of the people and the prevailing trend of the time. "The international community needs to firm up confidence, safeguard peace and stability, and jointly meet challenges with closer dialogue and communication," Li said. Li said China appreciates the WEF's consistent focus on economic development and stronger cooperation with China. Furthermore, deeper cooperation between China and the WEF will help send the world a positive message of growing the economy and improving lives. Noting that the WEF has maintained a good partnership with China for more than four decades, Schwab said the WEF is ready to deepen cooperation with China to promote global dialogue. He added the two sides should leverage the business community's role, enhance international and regional exchange and cooperation, and play a positive role in tackling climate change, promoting industry transformation, and advancing social fairness.
