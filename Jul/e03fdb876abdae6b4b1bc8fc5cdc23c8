Roast meats are a traditional delicacy in Hong Kong. The secret behind the flavor of roast goose comes from the sauce, which can either be used to season the meat or be served alone. According to Chua Lam, a famous Hong Kong food connoisseur, steamed rice flour with roast goose sauce brings a "taste of home" to many Hong Kong people.
