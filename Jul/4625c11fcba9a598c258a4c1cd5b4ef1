China's General Administration of Customs has decided to further improve the COVID-19 prevention and control measures over imported cold-chain food products to ensure the safety of the industry and supply chains, according to a notice issued by the administration on Friday. The notice said customs will carry out coronavirus nucleic acid tests and monitoring on imported cold-chain food products. In light of the test results, customs authorities will inspect and investigate prevention measures adopted by exporting countries and regions according to law, in order to confirm whether their safety management system and conditions are consistent with China's import requirements. According to relevant laws and regulations, measures such as rectification within a specified time limit, import suspension and cancellation of registration shall be taken to deal with overseas enterprises with problems. Imported cold-chain food products with positive nucleic acid test results shall be disposed of per their category and risk levels. Read more: Why is cold chain always a risk point for COVID-19?
