With the central government's support and the improving governance capability of the local authority, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) can expect to enjoy a brighter future, Chinese President Xi Jinping said. Xi set out four wishes while delivering a speech at a ceremony held on Friday morning to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the inauguration of the sixth-term government of the HKSAR. The president said he hoped the HKSAR government will improve its governance capability. "Improving its governance system, enhancing its governance capability and effectiveness are the urgent needs for the HKSAR government to ensure the success and development of the region," said Xi. Citing the unique position and advantages of Hong Kong, he said there is broad space for the region's development. "The central government fully supports Hong Kong in seizing the historic opportunity brought by national development to actively participate in multiple national strategies, including the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-2025), the development of the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area and the Belt and Road Initiative," Xi said. The central government will fully support Hong Kong in actively and prudently advancing reform, breaking the barriers of vested interests and fully unleashing the great creativity and development vitality of Hong Kong society, he said. Acknowledging the biggest wish of Hong Kong residents is to enjoy a better life, Xi said he hoped the HKSAR government will take account of the expectations of the whole society, especially ordinary residents, as the top pursuit of their governance. He also encouraged residents in Hong Kong to work together to build a harmonious and stable society. (Cover: A view of the Victoria Harbour in Hong Kong, China, July 1, 2022. /CFP)
