China's centrally-administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) reported steady revenue and profit growths in the first half of 2022, the state-asset regulator said Saturday. Net profits of central SOEs totaled 1.086 trillion yuan ($160.9 billion) in the first six months of the year, an increase of 6.1 percent over the same period last year, said the State Council's State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). From January to June, the country's 97 central SOEs raked in 19.2 trillion yuan in combined revenue, up 12 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, overall total profits of China's central SOEs reached 1.4 trillion yuan in the first half, up 7.1 percent year-on-year. According to the SASAC, operating profit margin of central SOEs was at a relatively high level and the ratio of liabilities to assets remained stable in the first half of the year.
