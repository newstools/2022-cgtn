Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida on Monday said he will continue working on a constitutional amendment following the killing of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Kishida made the promise as he addressed the public on Monday after strong upper house election results for his party and its coalition partner that virtually ensured him three more years as leader. He also touched on issues including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia-Ukraine conflict, as well as soaring prices, and vowed to tackle difficulties Japan faces in a time which he called "one of the biggest challenges after the war."
