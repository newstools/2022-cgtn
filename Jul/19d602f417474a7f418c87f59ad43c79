A century on from its racing debut, Aston Martin's original Grand Prix car is set to roar back into action on Tuesday for a celebratory lap. This weekend's race sees Aston Martin mark the centenary of its maiden challenge at the 1922 French Grand Prix, with no current Formula One manufacturer enjoying such an early history of top-flight competition. Ahead of Sunday's Grand Prix, four-time F1 world champion Sebastian Vettel will get the chance to pilot TT1 – affectionately nicknamed Green Pea – around Circuit Paul Ricard. (With input from AP)
