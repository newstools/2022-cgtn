Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday sent a congratulatory message to Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah al-Sisi on Egypt's 70th National Day. Egypt has been firmly committed to an independent path in recent years, Xi said, hailing the country's prosperous development and significant influence in regional and international affairs. Xi recalled the High-level Dialogue on Global Development last month, which both leaders attended. He described the dialogue as "fruitful," adding that it was a strong call for achieving common development and prosperity. Xi said he attaches great importance to the development of China-Egypt relations and stands ready to make joint efforts with President Sisi to firmly support each other, and promote bilateral cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Proposed by China in 2013, the BRI comprises the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. It aims to build trade and infrastructure networks connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along and beyond the ancient Silk Road routes. Xi added that he is ready to work with the Egyptian president on cooperation to implement the Global Development Initiative (GDI), safeguard the common interests of developing countries, and strive for the goal of building a China-Egypt community with a shared future in the new era so as to benefit the two countries and their peoples. China proposed the GDI in September last year to promote international cooperation to implement the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
