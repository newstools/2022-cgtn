Kirk Apesland is a retired Canadian who has lived in Nanning, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, for nearly 20 years. He believes China's rapid growth over the past 20 years results from massive urbanization. Large-scale urbanization has not only facilitated the construction of urban infrastructure, including housing and transportation, but also enabled more rural farmers to access better health and education. It has also dramatically changed their outlook, giving farmers' children more options, such as becoming lawyers and doctors, among others. CGTN Global Stringer invited him to make a video in which he shares his thoughts on Chinese urbanization.
