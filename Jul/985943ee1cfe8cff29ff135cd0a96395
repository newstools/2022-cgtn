Beijing reiterated its warning against U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's possible trip to Taiwan. "China has recently expressed firm opposition to Speaker Pelosi's planned trip to Taiwan. Besides the foreign ministry, the defense ministry and the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office have also made statements," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian on Thursday at a regular press briefing. "It shows again that in order to make personal gains, some U.S. politicians want China-U.S. ties to be strained. They want the cross-strait situation to be destabilized, and they want the world to descend into chaos," Zhao said, again warning of consequences. "China's defense ministry has said if the U.S. insists on the trip, our military will not sit idle and will take strong measures to defeat any interference by foreign forces that attempt to separate Taiwan. The Chinese will follow through with this promise."
