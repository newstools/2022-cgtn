China's GDP grew by 2.5-percent year on year in the first half of 2022 and 0.4-percent in the second quarter, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Yao Yang, dean and professor at Peking University's National School of Development, says the pandemic-induced slowdown of China's economy and labor market challenges are temporary. Professor Yao adds that the economic hit mainly occurred in April and that many of China's economic indicators in June have rebounded.
