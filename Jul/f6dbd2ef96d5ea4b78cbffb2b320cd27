Indiana state senators narrowly passed a near-total abortion ban on Saturday that includes exceptions for rape and incest, albeit with the requirement that such patients must sign a notarized affidavit to prove the attack, AP reported on Saturday. The bill passed the Republican-controlled Senate by 26 to 20, achieving the minimum 26 votes needed to submit it to the Republican-controlled House. The bill would ban abortions from the time a fertilized egg implants in a uterus.
