Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday reiterated that the Taiwan region is an inalienable part of China's territory, and the so-called median line does not exist. Following the commissioning of Haixun 06, the largest maritime patrol ship in the Taiwan Straits, on Monday in Fuzhou, capital of Fujian Province, Taiwan authorities warned the Chinese mainland to not "undermine the status quo in the Taiwan Straits and challenge the international order on the pretext of carrying out official duties," claiming the "median line" ensured "non-aggression and non-transgression." In response, Zhu stressed that the Haixun 06 is tasked with conducting law-enforcement patrols, searching for and rescuing ships and crew, monitoring maritime traffic, responding to emergencies as well as handling pollution. The ship is expected to play an important role in ensuring the navigation order and the safety of crucial waterways in the coastal waters off Fujian, she added, urging the Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authorities to stop political manipulation on the issue.
