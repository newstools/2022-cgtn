Over the past two decades, more than 60,000 people living in poor areas of China have settled in a new home – Minning Town. This poverty alleviation scheme was set up in 1997 by Xi Jinping, who was then deputy Party chief of Fujian Province. Xi was in charge of Fujian's effort to assist Ningxia. He proposed a resettlement program, under which entire village communities in poorer areas such as Xihaigu would be moved to the more fertile land near the Yellow River.
