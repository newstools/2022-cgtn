Elena Rybakina of Kazakhstan defeated Ons Jabeur of Tunisia 2-1 in the Wimbledon Championships women's singles final on Saturday to win her first Grand Slam title. "I was super nervous before the match, during the match and I'm happy it's finished. I have never felt something like this," said Rybakina, who looked extremely calm during the whole tournament even she lost the opening set in the final 3-6. But the big-hitting Rybakina found her powerful serve and precise return soon, winning the following two sets 6-2 and 6-2. "It's true I did not expect to be in the second week of a Grand Slam at Wimbledon," said the 23-year-old, whose previous best result at a Grand Slam was a quarterfinal finish at last year's French Open. "To be a winner is just amazing. I don't have the words to say how happy I am." Jabeur, 27, has become the first African woman in a Grand Slam final in the Open Era after beating close friend Tatjana Maria of Germany 6-2, 3-6, 6-1 in the semifinals. "I love this tournament so much and I feel really sad, but I'm trying to inspire many generations from my country. I hope they are listening," said the world No. 2.
