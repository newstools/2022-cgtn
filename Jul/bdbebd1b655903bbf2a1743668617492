China and Indonesia will strengthen cooperation in vaccine and genomic research, development and production, according to a joint press statement released by China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday. China vows to support Indonesia in its effort to set up a regional vaccine hub. The two countries have signed a slew of documents on cooperation in areas including research and development in vaccine and genomics, green development and cyber security construction during Indonesian President Joko Widodo's visit in China. In a high-level meeting in early July, regarding anti-COVID-19 cooperation with Indonesia, China said it is ready to help Indonesia increase its vaccine production capacity and advance the construction of a joint research center for vaccines and genes. As of last December, China donated a total of 4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, 120 ventilators and 400 oxygen generators to Indonesia as China continues to help Indonesia fight against COVID-19.
