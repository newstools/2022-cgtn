A crested serpent eagle was captured by infrared camera for the first time in Nanjing City, east China's Jiangsu Province. It was found during the new round of terrestrial wildlife biodiversity survey held by Jiangsu Academy of Science. As its name suggests, the eagle is a medium-sized bird that feeds on snakes and lizards. It is found in forested habitats across Asia. The bird is under second-class state protection in China.
