The World Economic Forum is virtually holding The New Champion Dialogues on July 18-19, with the theme "Navigating Uncertainty." The online gathering is taking place amid prolonged pandemic and geopolitical tensions. To better understand today's challenges, hot button topics this year include economic stability, technological innovation and climate change. The summit also focuses on a country going through rapid technological transformation: China. It provides a forum for global leaders to engage with their Chinese peers on innovations and solutions. So, how would these dialogues likely pan out? Could they help get a better sense of global crises? On that, CGTN host Tian Wei talked to Borge Brende, the WEF president.
