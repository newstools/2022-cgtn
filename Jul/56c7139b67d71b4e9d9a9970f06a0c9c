U.S. President Joe Biden's approval rating fell by three points to 36 percent this week, tying the lowest rating of his 19 months in the White House, as inflation takes a toll on American life, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday. Biden's approval rating has been below 50 percent since August 2021, and has hovered around its record-low since first hitting it in May, raising alarms that his Democratic Party is on track to lose control of at least one chamber of Congress in the November 8 midterm elections.
