The world's largest giant waterlily – and the first to be discovered in over a century – was unveiled at London's Kew Gardens, whose herbarium has been home to misidentified plant species for 177 years. The species was uncovered by a UK team and its partners in Bolivia, where the plant is native, using a blend of modern science, including DNA analysis and molecular technology, and the centuries-old practice of botanical drawings.
