Tiger Woods has reiterated his opposition to the Saudi-backed breakaway golf series fronted by Greg Norman and questioned whether its younger recruits would ever be able to compete in the majors. Speaking in a press conference ahead of the 150th Open Championship, the 15-time major winner said he could not understand why the likes of Phil Mickelson, Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka had "turned their backs" on the PGA Tour to join LIV Golf's series of 48-man, 54-hole events.
