Women's education and employment has been in the spotlight with a dedicated session held to exchange views at the China-Central Asia Cooperation Forum. It comes as this year's event marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the five central Asian countries – Kyrgyzstan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. As these countries marked three decades of diplomatic ties, they continue to work together to advance their mutual goals. During the forum held on Wednesday, delegates from China and five central Asian neighbors exchanged views on progress. "We offer social assistance to help women fight against poverty in Kyrgyzstan," said Zamira Akbagysheva, head of Congress of Women in Kyrgyzstan, adding that the amount of subsidies has raised to 56 percent. "Our extreme poverty level has declined accordingly." Next, Akbagysheva said that they will implement consensus reached by leaders from China and five Central Asian countries. Participants also agreed, in the spirit of China's Belt and Road Initiative, that exchanges and cooperation between women's groups should be deepened. The China-Central Asia Cooperation Forum started its 9th session both online and offline in the cities of Beijing, Shenyang and Dalian. Ten years on, the event has been acting as a platform to form closer ties and cooperation even amid the pandemic. "Despite COVID-19, close cooperation continues between China and Central Asian countries," said Shen Yueyue, vice chairperson of China's National People's Congress Standing Committee, stressing that from offering medical supplies to sending expert teams and vaccines, "we have been building a community of health with concrete actions." Representatives also jointly proposed initiatives to better consolidate the outcome of the forum for building a closer China-Central Asia community with a shared future.
