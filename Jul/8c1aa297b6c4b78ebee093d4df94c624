Multiple new species and new records of deep-sea brittle stars from the South China Sea and the Northwest Pacific Ocean have been found by the Institute of Deep-sea Science and Engineering, which is affiliated with the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) and its partner. Researchers identified 36 brittle star species from different orders, families and genera among samples collected by China's deep-sea manned submersible "Deep Sea Warrior" from scientific expeditions between 2016 and 2021. Seven were new species of brittle stars and 15 were new records that provide data for further understanding of deep-sea brittle star biodiversity. Some 2,100 species of brittle stars are known to exist. They are the most common echinoderms but are rarely seen as many live at the bottom of the sea or attached to corals and are more active at night. They are related to sea stars, but belong to a different class. Studies by the researchers were published in ZooKeys and the European Journal of Taxonomy.
