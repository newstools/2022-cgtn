Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree extending a simplified Russian naturalization process to all citizens of Ukraine. Previously, this option had been only open to residents of eastern Ukraine's self-proclaimed breakaway regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and the regions of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia, which are largely under Russian control. The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry said Moscow's move violated Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and international law.
