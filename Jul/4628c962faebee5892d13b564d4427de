The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approved Boeing's inspection and modification plan on Friday, clearing the way to resume deliveries of 787 Dreamliners, Reuters has reported, citing sources. The approved proposal requires specific inspections to confirm that an airplane's condition meets requirements and that all work has been completed, which should allow Boeing to resume deliveries in August after halting them in May 2021, the sources said.
