France's divided parliament on Friday passed the first major piece of legislation since elections last month, greenlighting a 20-billion-euro ($20-billion) package to help low-income families struggling with inflation. The so-called "emergency purchasing power bill" passed with 341 MPs in favor, 116 against and 21 abstentions. It includes a range of measures designed to help consumers, such as extending fuel tax cuts, raising pensions and benefits, and capping rent increases, and gives the government power to tackle a looming energy crisis caused by the fallout from Russia's "military operation" in Ukraine.
