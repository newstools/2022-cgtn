China sent a new data relay satellite into orbit from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province Wednesday. The Tianlian II-03 satellite was launched at 12:30 a.m. Wednesday Beijing Time by a Long March-3B carrier rocket. The Tianlian II-03 is China's second-generation geosynchronous orbit data relay satellite. It will provide data relay and TT&C (telemetry, tracking and command) services for manned spacecraft, as well as low- and middle-orbit resources satellites. It will also support the TT&C for spacecraft launch. Wednesday's launch is the 426th flight mission of the Long March carrier rocket series.
