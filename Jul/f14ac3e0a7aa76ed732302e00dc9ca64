Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi handed in his resignation on Thursday to President Sergio Mattarella, who has asked him to remain in office in a caretaker capacity, the head of state's office said in a statement. However, it did not say whether Mattarella would dissolve parliament or call early elections. Draghi had tendered his resignation on July 14 after populist coalition partner Five Star withdrew its support in a confidence vote. However, the president had not accepted the resignation and invited the prime minister to appear before parliament to make a statement.
