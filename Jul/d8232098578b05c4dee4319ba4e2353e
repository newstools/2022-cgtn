UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he would leave the office with his "head held high" despite the downfall of his scandal-hit leadership in a febrile first session of questions in parliament after his resignation. The first round of voting among Tory MPs is being held on Wednesday in the UK as the month-long process to select a new leader begins. Contenders will receive 30 votes to qualify for the second ballot on Thursday.
