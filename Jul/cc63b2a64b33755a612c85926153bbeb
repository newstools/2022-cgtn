The U.S. Senate on Wednesday confirmed President Joe Biden's nominee, Michael Barr, to be the Federal Reserve’s top regulator, a key oversight role for U.S. fiscal policy. A former Treasury official who worked on banking reform and the creation of the Bureau of Consumer Protection in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, Barr was approved by a vote of 66-28.
