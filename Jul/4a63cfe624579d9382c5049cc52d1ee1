The solar terms are the seasonal division points on the Chinese lunar calendar. In the past, Chinese people used the system to schedule their agricultural activities or alter their diet at various times of the year. Today, lots of traditions and customs regarding the 24 solar terms, such as eating special foods, are still popular in the country. In 2016, China's 24 solar terms were inscribed on UNESCO's Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.  Designer: Xing Cheng Editor: Chen Bo Producer: Wu Haixia
