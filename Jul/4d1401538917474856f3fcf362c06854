The Beijing Health Kit, a smartphone app that stores users' COVID-19-related health data, is adding a new feature that enables checking results of PCR nucleic acid tests done outside the city. The kit, which also appears as a mini-program within China's largest message platform, displays COVID-19 test results, vaccination history and is useful for contact tracing. It has become a necessary tool to move around the city as a negative result within 72 hours is required to enter public spaces in Beijing, like public transportation, supermarkets and banks. But so far, only results of tests taken in Beijing would show up on the Health Kit. The new feature, introduced on Saturday, can be seen under the section of "PCR test and vaccination inquiry," where users can upload a screenshot of a PCR test result done in other cities. China's National Health Commission on Friday issued a notice that requires local governments to join the efforts to promote the nationwide connectivity of COVID-19 test results. The statement said that results of all forms, including from each province's health kit, the websites of PRC testing labs, or printed results, should be recognized at the local level as long as they are within the required time period in accordance with the local disease containment measures.
