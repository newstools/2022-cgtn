In 1901, 11-year-old Milton Gardner moved from the U.S. to Fujian Province, China, with his missionary parents. He spent a happy and unforgettable childhood there but was never able to revisit his beloved "Kuliang." On his deathbed, he uttered the words "Kuliang, Kuliang." Gardner's wife, Elizabeth, traveled to China, hoping to find the place her husband adored, but to no avail – until Xi Jinping heard the story in 1992.
