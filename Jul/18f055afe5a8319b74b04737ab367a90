Inter Milan's activity in the transfer market continues as the Nerazzurri completed the signing of Henrikh Mkhitaryan from Serie A rival Roma. Mkhitaryan spent the past three seasons at Roma after spells in England with Manchester United and Arsenal. Inter also registered a contract with the league's governing body for 26-year-old Cameroon goalkeeper Andre Onana, who joins from Ajax. Both have signed as free agents. The deals come two days after Romelu Lukaku returned to Inter, who also signed Kristjan Asllani on loan from Empoli. (With input from AP)
