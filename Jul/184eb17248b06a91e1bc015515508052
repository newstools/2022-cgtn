U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday said the United States "will not walk away" from the Middle East, adding that American interests are linked to successes in the region. Biden made the remarks during a summit between the United States, six Gulf states and Egypt, Jordan and Iraq in the Saudi Arabian city of Jeddah. He said his administration's "new framework" for the Middle East could be summed up in one sentence: "The United States is invested in building a positive future of the region, in partnership with all of you – and the U.S. is not going anywhere." The U.S. president, who started his trip to the region with a visit to Israel, held bilateral talks with the leaders of Iraq, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates before taking part in the wider summit. Biden announced $1 billion in aid for food security assistance in the Middle East and North Africa. Biden added that the U.S. would continue its diplomatic efforts to put pressure on the Iranian nuclear program, and "we are keen that Tehran does not obtain a nuclear weapon." Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, addressing the U.S.-Arab summit, said that unified efforts were required to support the global economy and that unrealistic policies regarding energy sources would only lead to inflation.
