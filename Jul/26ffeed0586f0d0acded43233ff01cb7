The opening ceremony of the upgraded Guangdong Chinese Medicine Museum was held on Monday, with its trial run starting on Tuesday. The upgraded museum now boasts a new Lingnan Chinese medicine hall, acupuncture hall and wellness center. The museum's functionality has also been improved, making it more convenient for visitors to learn more about Chinese medicine. The exhibition area of Lingnan Chinese herbal medicine showcases "wet specimens." It displays 600 bottles of colorful and delicate specimens of medicinal herbs, earning it the name "Crystal Palace of Chinese Medicine." As the younger generation pays more attention to the rich cultural history of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the development of this branch of medicine has gotten stronger. TCM inheritors are also making every effort to perpetuate and disseminate TCM culture. Yang Xuejun is an entrepreneur who has been interested in TCM since he was a child. His family has been working in the field for generations, which has left an indelible mark on him. Yang is deeply interested in spreading the culture of Chinese medicine and has raised funds to build a Chinese medicine museum in Dalian. Education in TCM culture has also made its way into schools. On June 17, Nanning Yulan Road Primary School students visited the Zhuang medicine experience hall to experience unique cultural and creative products, such as Chinese medicine and medicinal cuisine. Lu'an, a prefecture-level city in western Anhui Province, has developed a complementary industry where villagers grow medicinal herbs to generate and increase income.
