British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended his three years in power as his government survived a no-confidence vote. The prime minister's speech in the House of Commons on Monday evening opened the debate on a vote of no-confidence that his government won by 349 to 238, a majority of 111. Meanwhile, former British finance minister Rishi Sunak won the most support in the third round of voting to find a replacement for Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday.
