Jos Buttler has been named as Eoin Morgan's successor as England's limited-overs captain, taking over the one-day and T20 sides with immediate effect. Morgan announced his retirement from international cricket on Tuesday and the England and Wales Cricket Board has wasted little time in rubberstamping the wicketkeeper’s promotion. The 31-year-old has deputised for Morgan on 14 occasions, including the side's previous ODI in Amstelveen after Morgan sat out with a groin injury. Buttler will take charge of 12 games in July, with T20 and ODI series against India and South Africa.
