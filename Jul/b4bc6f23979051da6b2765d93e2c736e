Philippine President Ferdinand Romualdez Marcos arrived in the earthquake-hit Abra province on Thursday with other government officials. "I agree to what we usually do – work together with the local government so that we can make sure" the affected individuals can receive assistance from the government, Marcos said during a situation briefing in the provincial capital Bangued. A magnitude-7 quake hit Abra on Wednesday, killing four people so far and injuring at least 131 people. On Wednesday night, reports said that five people had died. Officials revised the death toll on Thursday after confirming that the quake did not cause a fatality in the city of Gattaran. The president ordered the immediate dispatch of rescue and relief teams to Abra on Wednesday, according to his press secretary. (With input from agencies)
