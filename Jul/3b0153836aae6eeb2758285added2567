The top three selections of the 2022 NBA Draft, Paolo Banchero, Chet Holmgren and Jabari Smith Jr., made their appearances in the NBA Summer League, both making highlights and showing shortcomings. Banchero displayed great ability to launch offense by himself in the Orlando Magic. By exploiting his solid skills, size, power and athleticism, he can drop good numbers in his rookie season. Holmgren was considered to be a future Defensive Player of the Year and he was performing excellently denying shots for the Oklahoma City Thunder in some of the games. However, he was also dominated by undrafted Kenneth Lofton Jr. in the game against the Memphis Grizzlies. Smith Jr. is the best 3-point shooter of the three, but unlike the other two, he lacks the ability to create his own shots. That's why his role in the Houston Rockets is limited because he often has to wait for Jalen Green or others to feed him on the offensive end.
