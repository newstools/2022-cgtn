Girder erection was completed last week of the first super-large railway bridge of the China-Thailand high-speed railway project. The first stage of the project involves a 252.3-kilometer-long railway section from capital city Bangkok to Kele, with a designed speed of 250 km/h. The railway is the country's first standard-gauge railway applying Chinese standards. The design team made the piers in the shape of a "slim waist" to highlight local art style, and met the country's lightweight architectural style while optimizing pier size and slope ratio. Thailand has been working in close liaison with China on building the high-speed rail line which will serve as a vital mid-section of the extensive Trans-Asian Railway Network linking China with Singapore, one of the most striking cooperative projects between China and ASEAN countries. As a flagship project under the Belt and Road Initiative, the railway will effectively improve infrastructure and connectivity in Thailand and the region at large after its completion. The railway will link with the China-Laos Railway and promote trade and personnel exchanges among countries.
