The practice of "One Country, Two Systems" has achieved success in Hong Kong recognized by all, President Xi Jinping said in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) on Friday. Xi made the remarks when he addressed the meeting celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the inaugural ceremony of the sixth-term government of the HKSAR. Xi said Hong Kong's return opened a new epoch in its history. Since its return to the motherland, Hong Kong has made irreplaceable contributions to the miracle of long-term, steady and fast economic development of the motherland, Xi said. Hong Kong has become an integral part of the country's overall development and actively aligned with national development strategies, Xi said. It has continued to maintain the strengths of being highly free and open and compatible with international rules, Xi added. Hong Kong has played an important role in advancing the new paradigm of China's opening-up on a larger scale, across more areas and in greater depth, Xi said.
