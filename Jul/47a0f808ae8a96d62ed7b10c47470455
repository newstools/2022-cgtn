Two dozen global sports icons, including former tennis star Ashleigh Barty, soccer player Harry Kane and former cricketer Brian Lara, will compete in a series of competitive team matchplay format events at the Liberty National Golf Club in Jersey City. Fourballs, greensomes and singles competitions will take place across Friday and Saturday. Three-time Grand Slam champion Barty said she is ready for the "challenge" of the "exciting initiative" provided by the inaugural 2022 Icon Series event. "(I am) pumped to be here this week to play my role, to play my part, have fun and enjoy it with some other athletes that love the game of golf." Barty, who retired from tennis in March as world number one having won the Australian Open, French Open and Wimbledon across the past three years, praised the "rapid growth" of women's sport on the global stage. "I believe that Australian golf, particularly on the women's side, is some of the best in the world. And they have done an incredible job in bringing more girls into the sport, to be able to enjoy it, embrace it, put it on the map, and women's sport is growing rapidly," she said.
