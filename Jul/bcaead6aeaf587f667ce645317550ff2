The death toll in the massive landslide in India's northeastern state of Manipur rose to 27 on Saturday, state-run broadcaster All India Radio said. "In Manipur, with six more bodies of army personnel found this morning from the debris of landslides in Noney district, the number of dead has gone up to 27," the broadcaster said. The landslide on Thursday hit Tupul yard railway construction camp in Noney district, where some Territorial Army (TA) personnel were guarding a major railway line construction site. The dead have been identified as TA personnel and civilians who were working near the railways. Rescue operations for the missing continued for the third straight day. Early media reports said nearly 40 people were still missing.
