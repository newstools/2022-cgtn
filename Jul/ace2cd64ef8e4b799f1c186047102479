China's Wang Jianan took gold in the men's long jump final at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon, U.S., on Saturday. This was Team China's first gold medal in Eugene, as well as in the long jump event at the World Championships history. Wang stunned those ahead of him in his last bid when he leaped 8.36m, which put him atop. He was placed fifth with 8.03m from his third attempt to qualify for the last three jumps with seven others, but was still at 8.03m after the fifth round. He overtook Miltiadis Tentoglou from Greece (8.32m) in a history-making last jump to record 8.36m. Also on Saturday, defending champion Gong Lijiao from China took silver in the women's shot put final while compatriot Song Jiayuan finished 6th. Olympic gold medalist Gong, 33, threw 20.39m to put herself on Worlds' podium for the seventh consecutive time from all eight trips. She has won two golds, two silvers, and three bronzes at Worlds so far, but she isn't planning to stop. "My ultimate dream is to break the 21m barrier. I hope to reach my goal at or before the next Olympics in Paris," Gong said before the final. She won her first Olympic gold medal with 20.58m in Tokyo last year. Chase Ealey from the U.S. took gold with 20.49m, and Jessica Schilder from the Netherlands took bronze with 19.77m. In the women's 100m, China's Ge Manqi entered the semifinal clocking 11.17 seconds in the preliminary round. China's star sprinter Su Bingtian concluded his individual competition after finishing eighth in the second heat of the men's 100m semifinal, and will lead the Chinese squad in the men's 4x100m relay in five days.
