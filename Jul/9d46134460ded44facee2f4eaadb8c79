Taiwan compatriots should get a good grasp of the overarching development trend of cross-strait relations, firmly stand on the right side of history and resolutely oppose separatist acts of "Taiwan independence," China's top political advisor Wang Yang said Wednesday. Wang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, made his remarks at the 14th Straits Forum, which began on July 12 in the coastal city of Xiamen, southeast China's Fujian Province. Noting compatriots on both sides are brothers of the same blood, he stressed that since the 18th CPC National Congress, the Party has implemented its overall policy for resolving the Taiwan question in the new era and adhered to the one-China principle and the 1992 Consensus to promote the peaceful development of cross-strait relations. Wang mentioned the Party has continued its efforts to improve the system and policies for safeguarding the welfare of Taiwan compatriots and to ensure that Taiwan compatriots on the mainland enjoy equal treatment with mainland residents, especially Taiwan youth, to study, work, start businesses and live on the mainland. By having a strong motherland to rely on, the livelihood of Taiwan compatriots will improve and they will have more space for development, he said. Wang also urged the youth on both sides of the Taiwan Straits to work together toward unity, and encouraged more Taiwan youths to come to the mainland to pursue their dreams and fulfill their dreams, demonstrating their brilliance in the course of realizing national rejuvenation. This year's forum carries on the theme of promoting people-to-people exchanges and deepening integrated development across the Taiwan Straits. A total of 43 events are taking place both online and offline, with around 2,000 people from Taiwan expected to join offline activities.
