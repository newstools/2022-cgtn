Orders for sports paraphernalia are coming in strong and fast to the export hub of Yiwu in Zhejiang Province, known as the "world's small commodities capital." Local businessman Wu Xiaoming, who has been manufacturing licensed products since the 1998 World Cup, is authorized to produce footballs printed with the flags of this year's 32 competing nations. Merchants selling flags, trumpets and bracelets representing various teams have also seen a spike in orders.
