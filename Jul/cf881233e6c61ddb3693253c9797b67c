The former president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore, was sentenced in absentia to life imprisonment for the assassination of revolutionary icon Thomas Sankara in 1987. He apologized to Sankara's family on Tuesday, AFP reported. "I ask the Burkinabe people for forgiveness for all the acts I may have committed during my tenure, and especially the family of my brother and friend Thomas Sankara," he said in a message read out by government spokesman Lionel Bilgo. Compaore seized power in the West African nation in a coup in 1987 in which Sankara was gunned down by a hit squad.
