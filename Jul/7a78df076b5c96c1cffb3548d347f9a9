New discoveries of two Terracotta Warriors unearthed in the burial pits of the Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor have been released. One of the terracotta figures, numbered 4 wears a jacket studded with bubble studs. The cloth below the waist is decorated with fine patterns. The remaining painted patterns mainly focus on the tops, collar edges, sleeve edges, and waistbands of trousers, featuring octagonal, geometric, and cloud patterns in white, black, yellow, and purple, said Zhou Ping, a researcher of Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum. According to research, silk is most likely the fabric of figure No.4's cloth. The original appearance of the figure is much more complete after the restoration carried out by Emperor Qinshihuang's Mausoleum Site Museum and China Silk Museum. The other figure, No. 28, lies on its back and was difficult to protect and repair, which took the researchers nine months to complete. Researchers used high-precision 3D surface scanning and texture photography techniques to build a precision modeling of No. 28, enabling people to have a better understanding of it. What's more, researchers found three fingerprints on the painted surface of the abdomen of the No. 28 figure. After analysis, they found that the characteristics of these three fingerprints were highly similar to teenagers, and it is highly possible that the artisan who left the fingerprints on the No. 28 figure is a teenager. Terracotta Warriors, one of the eight wonders of the world, have enjoyed international fame. Located in Xi'an City in northwest China's Shaanxi Province, they are of the Terracotta army of the first ever emperor in ancient China, or Qin Shi Huang in Chinese.
