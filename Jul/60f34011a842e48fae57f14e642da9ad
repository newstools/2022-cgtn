Acting Sri Lankan president Ranil Wickremesinghe has declared a state of public emergency, according to a government notice released late on Sunday, as his administration seeks to quell social unrest and tackle an economic crisis gripping the island nation. "It is expedient, so to do, in the interests of public security, the protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community," the notification stated. Sri Lanka's parliament is scheduled to elect a new president on July 20 following the resignation of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who flew to Singapore via the Maldives, amid a severe economic crisis in the South Asian country. Nominations for the presidential candidates will be called on Tuesday. Wickremesinghe is one of the top contenders to take on the presidency full-time. Rajapaksa has said he took "all possible steps" to avert the economic crisis that has engulfed the island nation. Sri Lanka's parliament met on Saturday to begin the process of electing a new president, and a shipment of fuel arrived to provide some relief to the crisis-hit nation. (With input from agencies)
