On the afternoon of July 26, the Baili Gallery scenic spot in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region's Nilka County, northwest China, saw a solar halo and circumhorizontal arc together. The sight was very rare. A circumhorizontal arc is a colorful, bright and near-horizon arc. The circumhorizontal arc occurs only when the sun is very high in the sky - higher than 58 degrees. Check out the video to see the rare scene. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
