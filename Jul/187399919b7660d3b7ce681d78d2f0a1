Former Japanese Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama has called on Tokyo to have more talks with Beijing and refrain from following the U.S. lead in encircling China. Japan's active participation in U.S.-led initiatives such as the Quad and the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework was "the de facto encirclement of China," Hatoyama told the World Peace Forum, an event hosted by Tsinghua University in Beijing, on Sunday. He blamed straining ties between China and Japan on Tokyo, accusing it of magnifying "differences and values." "It is not surprising that two independent countries have differences, but to use this as a reason for not communicating between leaders, this is foolish and a dereliction of diplomacy," said Hatoyama, who served as prime minister of Japan between 2009 and 2010. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's comments about China have derailed from reality, Hatoyama said, urging both the Japanese government and the U.S. to respect the one-China policy.
