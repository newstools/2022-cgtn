Russian and Ukrainian defense delegations have concluded their closed-door talks on unblocking Black Sea grain exports, the Turkish defense ministry said Wednesday, without disclosing details. The Turkish ministry issued a one-sentence statement saying the talks had "ended," without specifying if any progress had been made in the first direct negotiations between the two sides since March.
