A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Friday said Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities have brought "poisonous thorns" that lead to tension and turmoil in cross-Strait relations over the past six years. Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to media inquiries about senior DPP official Lai Ching-te's claim on Thursday that the DPP authorities extended an "olive branch" to the Chinese mainland twice, only to be ignored. For the past six years, the DPP authorities, for the sake of the party's selfish profits, have been engaged in political maneuvering and colluded with external forces to seek "Taiwan independence" and create cross-Strait confrontation, which has increasingly pushed Taiwan into a dangerous abyss, said Zhu. By calling what they had done as "gestures of goodwill," the DPP authorities were just deceiving themselves, she added.
