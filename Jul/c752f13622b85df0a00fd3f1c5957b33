Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) CEO Anko van der Werff said on Monday that negotiations between the company and the pilots' union had failed to reach an agreement, prompting some 900 pilots to strike. Pilots in Denmark, Sweden and Norway will join the strike, which SAS had previously said could leave some 30,000 passengers stranded each day. (With input from AFP)
