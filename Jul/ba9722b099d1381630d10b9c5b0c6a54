A senior Palestinian official on Monday accused the United States of protecting Israel after a forensic examination failed to reach a firm conclusion on the origin of the bullet that killed Al Jazeera journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Meanwhile, Israeli military said it would continue its examination of the shooting. The United States said Monday that Abu Akleh was likely killed by gunfire from Israeli positions but that there was no reason to believe her death was intentional. The State Department also said that the U.S. could not make a "definitive conclusion" on the origin of the bullet that killed her on May 11, which was handed over by the Palestinian Authority.
