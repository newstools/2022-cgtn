Defending champions and world No.1 Team USA were knocked out of the the Women's Volleyball Nations League (VNL) in quarterfinals after a surprise 3-2 loss to Serbia in Ankara, Turkey on Wednesday, the worst result since 2018. Team USA, also the Tokyo Olympics champions, swept Serbia 3-0 in the group stage earlier, but Serbia emerged on the winning end of a five-set battle to claim the win 29-27, 25-23, 20-25, 20-25, 15-13. The quarterfinal produced 35 blocks, 21 for the United States and 14 for Serbia. Serbian outside hitter Sara Lozo delivered the match high of 22 points, including four stuffs and three of the team's six aces, followed by U.S. captain Kelsey Robinson with 21 points and Ana Bjelica of Serbia with 20. "We prepared for it very well, played with a feeling, with a focus, and gave our maximum. We are always prepared to go five (sets), because we never lose five. It's incredible," said Ana Bjelica, opposite and captain of Serbia. "To beat the USA, the best team in the world at the moment, is really difficult." Serbia will next face Brazil in the semi-final after Brazil defeated Japan 3-1 (29-27, 28-26, 20-25, 25-14) in the opener earlier. China will meet Italy and host Turkey will battle against Thailand on Thursday. China beat Italy, which mainly comprised young players, 3-1 in the group stage, but with the return of superstar opposite Paola Egonu and spiker Lucia Bosetti, the Italian squad will definitely make grave challenges to Chinese players. Egonu led the Italian team to win eight consecutive games during the group stages, ranking third among all teams, a place ahead of China. (With input from Xinhua)
