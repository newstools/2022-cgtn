China's national women's team beat their counterparts from Chinese Taipei 2-0 in the opener at the East Asian Football Championship in Aichi, Japan, on Wednesday. 21-year-old Zhang Linyan opened the scoring for Team China in the 12th minute with a volley from inside the box. Team China went 2-0 ahead thanks to an own goal by Chinese Taipei defender Su Sin-yun 10 minutes later. Zhang is a rising star in the squad, who will join Swiss Women's Super League side Grasshopper Zurich on a one-year loan after the East Asian Football Championship. She delivered a stunning performance in the 2022 AFC Women's Asian Cup final after her substitution in the second half. Zhang scored her maiden goal for the national team to level the game in the 71st minute, helping China complete a 3-2 comeback victory over South Korea. She was also named the Future Star of the final. China will next face arch-rivals South Korea on Saturday and Japan next Tuesday. Also on Wednesday, China's men's football team suffered a 3-0 defeat by South Korea due to an own goal and defense errors. Mainly comprised of U23 players, South Korea controlled and dominated the pitch throughout the game. They aim for clean victories to defend their title at the tournament for a third time. Without calling back ace players in the European leagues such as star Son Heung-min, South Korea are making use of the event to scout substitutes for the upcoming World Cup, which will be held at the end of the year in Qatar.
