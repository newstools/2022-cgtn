Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive John Lee met with Vice Minister of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and China Media Group (CMG) President and Editor-in-Chief Shen Haixiong and his colleagues at the Government House on Friday noon. They became Lee's first guests after being sworn in as chief executive that morning. As a member of the central government's delegation to Hong Kong to attend the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland and the inauguration of the HKSAR's sixth-term government, Shen led a nearly 400-member live broadcast team that provided comprehensive coverage. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of the establishment of the HKSAR, CGTN Documentary and Radio The Greater Bay under CMG were officially launched in Hong Kong on July 1, 2022 through the television and radio channels as well as the online platform of Radio Television Hong Kong, enabling Hong Kong residents to understand the latest developments of the country and enhance their sense of national identity and promoting Hong Kong's proactive integration into the overall development of the country. Lee welcomed Shen's visit to Hong Kong, and thanked CMG, including its Asia Pacific branch, for its continuous support for the HKSAR government. He expressed his full recognition and gratitude for CMG's professional dedication, and hoped to cooperate with CMG in a comprehensive and in-depth manner to boost Hong Kong's development and its economic and social prosperity and to tell Hong Kong's stories to the world as Hong Kong opens its newest chapter. Lee expressed his gratitude to CMG for its comprehensive reports on the development of Hong Kong in various aspects, allowing mainland compatriots to know more about the HKSAR. Noting that the next five years will be a critical moment for Hong Kong to forge ahead from governance towards development and prosperity, he said that the HKSAR government will step up cooperation with CMG to leverage its international network to give full play to the national support for Hong Kong to develop as a hub for international arts and cultural exchanges under the National 14th Five-Year Plan to promote the magnificent Chinese culture. Shen thanked Chief Executive Lee for taking the time to meet with him, and said that he will be guided by the spirit of Chinese President Xi Jinping's important speech to play a greater role in promoting Hong Kong's transition from chaos to governance and prosperity and in writing a new chapter in the implementation of "One Country, Two Systems" in Hong Kong.
