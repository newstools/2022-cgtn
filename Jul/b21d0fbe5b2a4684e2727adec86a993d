German national carrier Lufthansa said Tuesday it would have to cancel almost all flights at its domestic hubs in Frankfurt and Munich because of a planned strike by ground crew, adding to a summer of travel chaos across Europe. "Lufthansa will have to call off almost the entire flight program at its hubs in Frankfurt and Munich for Wednesday," the group said in a statement.
