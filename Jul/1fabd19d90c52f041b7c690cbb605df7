A Chinese mainland spokesperson on Wednesday criticized Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) authorities for suppressing those who support reunification and oppose "Taiwan independence." According to media reports, Zhang Xiuye, secretary-general of the Chinese Patriot Alliance Association, and others were wanted by the DPP authorities for "violation of security law." Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the State Council Taiwan Affairs Office, refuted the accusations as purely false and malicious rumors. "It is another terrible political maneuver by the DPP authorities that seek 'Taiwan independence' in essence and aim for their own political profits to fabricate charges to suppress those on the island who support reunification and reject 'Taiwan independence.'"
