Recently, a heatwave swept across Europe. Many European countries, have experienced extreme weather and issued heat warnings. Meanwhile, with the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Europe is also facing an energy crisis, which has worsened the situation to a certain extent.CGTN Global Stringer takes us to the streets in the UK, Germany and Italy and listens to local residents on how they are coping with this unusually hot weather. An Italian resident says the current high temperature caused a massive increase in electricity usage for cooling, which led to constant blackouts during the daytime. The extreme temperature also caused the worst drought in 70 years. As a result, the local government has set limitations on water usage, and residents can use water every other day.
