The Chinese mainland on Tuesday criticized the secessionist You Si-kun for attempting to collude with some countries to seek "Taiwan independence." In response to media inquiries, Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, denounced the visit of You Si-kun, head of the legislative body of the Taiwan region, to the Czech Republic. Nothing can alter the fact that Taiwan is part of China, that "Taiwan independence" is a dead end, and that those who pursue it would end up being dealt with in accordance with law, said Zhu. The spokesperson also urged the relevant countries to realize the grave danger of "Taiwan independence" secessionist acts, abide by the one-China principle and the commitments they have made on the question, and to stop sending wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces. In November 2021, the Chinese mainland announced measures to punish die-hard secessionists, You Si-kun included, prohibiting them and their families from entering the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, and vowing to prosecute them for criminal liability, effective for life, in accordance with law.
