China said on Thursday that it looks to deepen strategic mutual trust and practical cooperation with Indonesia, after announcing President Joko Widodo's upcoming visit to China next week. President Widodo will be the first foreign head of state to visit China after the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympic Games, said Wang Wenbin, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry. According to Wang, Widodo is scheduled to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang. As both are developing countries, China and Indonesia are representatives of emerging economies that share extensive common interests and have broad space for cooperation, Wang said, adding that the two sides have confirmed the general direction of building a China-Indonesia community with a shared future. Indonesia holds the rotating presidency of the G20 this year, and China highly appreciates and firmly supports Indonesia's constructive role as the host country, Wang said.
