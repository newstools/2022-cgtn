The U.S. is sending more high-precision long-range weapons to Ukraine, as it prepares its latest military aid worth up to 400 million U.S. dollars. President Joe Biden signed the new weapons package on July 8. It includes four additional high mobility artillery rocket systems, or HIMARS. Earlier this week, Russia's defense ministry said it destroyed two HIMARS systems and their ammunition depots in eastern Ukraine.
