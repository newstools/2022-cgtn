Paris Saint-Germain held a training session in front of more than 13,000 spectators on Monday in Tokyo as part of their pre-season tour. Some enthusiastic supporters broke through the security barrier and entered the pitch, but their attempts were blocked by security guards. The French club are in Japan for a three-game tour over 10 days, where they will take on J.League sides Kawasaki Frontale, Urawa Reds and Gamba Osaka. (With input from AP)
