Germany has expressed concern that it could face a further suspension of gas supplies from Russia, following a planned maintenance shutdown of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline. The pipeline supplies gas to Europe from Russia under the Baltic Sea. It is scheduled to be closed for annual maintenance for about 10 days later this month.
