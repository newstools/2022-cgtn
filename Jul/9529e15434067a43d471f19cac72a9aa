The New York Mets of the Major League Baseball (MLB) retired the No. 17 jersey of their former first baseman Keith Hernandez before the game against the Miami Marlins at Citi Field in New York City on Saturday. "This is just a great moment for me," Hernandez said. "I never dreamed I'd be here this long, in the organization. I am absolutely humbled and proud that my number will be up in the rafters for eternity." Keith had a very successful career as a player. He was a five-time All-Star who won the Gold Glove Award 11 times and the Silver Slugger Award twice. He was named the National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1979 and helped the St. Louis Cardinals and Mets to win the World Series title in 1982 and 1986 respectively. That was one of the only two times the Mets have won the World Series in franchise history. Hernandez left the team to join the Cleveland Indians (renamed Guardians in 2021) in 1990 and retired after playing one season there. He is now a baseball commentator for Mets' television broadcasts on SNY and WPIX alongside Gary Cohen and Ron Darling. "I thank you. I'm truly overwhelmed," Hernandez said in front of the fans at Citi Field on Saturday. "He practically rewrote the manual on how to play first base," Mets radio announcer Howie Rose said. "He didn't simply play first base, he performed it – a virtuoso." Only Hall of Famers Tom Seaver (41) and Mike Piazza (31) saw their jerseys retired by the Mets ad players before Hernandez. Both were 12-time All-Stars. Seaver was the pitcher of the 1969 champion team. Piazza helped the team advance to the World Series in 2000. The other two retired jerseys belong to the team's former managers Casey Stengel (37) and Gil Hodges (14). "I am absolutely humbled and proud that my number will be up in the rafters for eternity along with Casey, Gil, Tom, Mike and Jerry," Hernandez said. "60 years of New York Mets."
