In the early hours of June 22, a magnitude-6.1 earthquake hit eastern Afghanistan. The quake was the deadliest and most disastrous to hit the country in two decades, causing more than 1,500 deaths. China has been actively providing aid to Afghan people to help tide them over during the difficult time, pledging 50 million yuan (about $7.5 million) in emergency humanitarian assistance to the country. Chinese companies in Afghanistan have also sent supplies of rice, flour, oil and tea to affected areas.
