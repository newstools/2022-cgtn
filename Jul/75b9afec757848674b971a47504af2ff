Generations of officers and soldiers have stood guard in southwest China's Medog over the last 60 years. Among them is Li Hongjin, who enlisted in the army and became a border soldier in 2020. Before coming to Medog, he worked as a firefighter for a year. He has overcome natural disasters, venomous snakes, and poisonous plants as a border guard. "I do not regret my decision. I carry a gun, defend the border, and guard the motherland's great rivers and mountains," Li said. "It's very cool. I like it."
