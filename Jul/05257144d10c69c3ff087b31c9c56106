Turkey is Europe's largest steel producer and the world's seventh-largest. The steel production capacity in Turkey has increased rapidly in recent years, with crude steel output hitting a record high of 40.4 million tonnes in 2021. But affected by the Ukraine crisis this year, the Turkish steel industry faces many challenges from rising costs and shrinking markets. Trade protectionist measures imposed by some Western countries led by the United States have also seriously affected Turkey's steel exports.
