Denmark's Jonas Vingegaard won the Tour de France on Sunday, ending the reign of two-time defending champion Tadej Pogacar after a grueling three weeks and 3,350 kilometers of relentless struggle. The 25-year-old former fish-market worker Vingegaard claimed his first Tour de France a year after his break-out performance when he came second to Pogacar in 2021. Belgium's Jasper Philipsen won the dash for the line on the cobbled Champs Elysees to take the iconic final stage victory. The ecstatic Philipsen lifted his bike aloft at the finish line after taking his second win of this tour, turning the page on his embarrassment at mistakenly celebrating on stage four, when he had in fact finished second. Vingegaard and his Jumbo-Visma teammates all crossed the line together in a line and cheering wildly. His Dutch team produced a brilliant collective effort with six stage wins, the green sprint jersey and the red combativity jersey for van Aert and the polka dot mountains jersey for Vingegaard as well as the overall title and yellow jersey. After a relentless struggle over peaks and plains in a crushing heatwave, Vingegaard assured his win on Saturday's time-trial having taken the lead in the Alps and extended it in the Pyrenees. Defeated champion Pogacar finished second, won the best under-25s jersey for the third time and leaves this tour with his reputation intact after attacking Vingegaard to the bitter end. Geraint Thomas, the 2018 champion, was third after the veteran raced largely at his own pace, silencing doubters who thought that at 36, the affable Welshman was past his best.
