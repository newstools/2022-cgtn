NASA unveiled a new batch of images from its powerful James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) on Tuesday. The first image from the $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope was released Monday at the White House. The four additional photos released Tuesday included more cosmic beauty shots, including one of the Carina Nebula, a bright stellar nursery located about 7,600 light-years away.
