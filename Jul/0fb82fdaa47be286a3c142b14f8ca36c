The European Commission has secured about 54,000 additional doses of the monkeypox vaccine developed by the biotech firm Bavarian Nordic as concern mounts over the disease amid a spike in cases, it said in a statement. The supply deal follows a first contract signed in June when the EU ordered about 110,000 Bavarian Nordic vaccine doses.
