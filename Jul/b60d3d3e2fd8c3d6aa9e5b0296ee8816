The Japanese government will restart 10 coal-fired power plants and as many old nuclear plants as possible to ensure electricity supply in the country, Prime Minister Fumio Kishida said at a press conference Thursday. Meanwhile, the government also plans to put up to nine nuclear plants in operation by this winter. "With priority in safety, we will take concrete steps to restart [plants]," Kishida said in May. "[Japan] will utilize nuclear reactors with safety assurances to contribute to worldwide reduction of dependence on Russian energy," he added.
