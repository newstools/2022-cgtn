U.S. President Joe Biden has declared that a major disaster exists in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and ordered Federal aid to supplement recovery efforts in the areas affected by severe storms, flooding, landslides, and mudslides which begun on Tuesday, and is continuing, said the White House on Friday. At least 16 people died in widespread flooding in eastern Kentucky, following heavy rains, Kentucky's governor Andy Beshear said on Friday. Beshear said that he expects the death toll to rise as rescue teams search the disaster area. "A series of storms drenching the eastern part of the state has dropped water that has yet to crest, leaving damage that could take years to repair," said Beshear, who declared a state of emergency in six counties on Thursday morning.
