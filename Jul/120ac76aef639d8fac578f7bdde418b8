After months of speculation, Ousmane Dembele has finally signed a new contract that will keep him at Barcelona until June 2024. The French winger's most recent contract expired last month and he was technically a free agent, but despite rumored interest from Chelsea and Paris St-Germain, he has finally put pen to paper, saying the Spanish club was always his first choice. Barca is enormously in debt and had tried to sell 25-year-old Dembele in January, but he is now understood to have agreed a substantial pay cut to remain at Camp Nou. Dembele joined Barcelona in 2017 on a then club-record transfer from German side Borussia Dortmund and has scored 32 goals and has 34 further assists in more than 150 appearances for the Catalan club.
