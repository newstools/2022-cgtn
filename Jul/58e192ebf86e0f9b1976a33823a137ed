England's Georgia Stanway scored with a wonderful extra-time strike to earn her side a 2-1 win over Spain on Wednesday in an excellent Euro 2022 quarterfinal that sent the Lionesses into the last four. Ether Gonzalez's opener had the hosts heading for an early exit, before Ella Toone rescued them six minutes from the end of normal time. Stanway's winner took England into the last four for a fourth consecutive major tournament. Sarina Wiegman's side will face Sweden or Belgium in one semifinal on Tuesday. England were given a boost pre-match with the return of Wiegman to the touchline after she tested negative for coronavirus earlier in the day. The Lionesses had everything their own way in the group stage as they plundered 14 goals without reply against Austria, Norway and Northern Ireland. Spain had been pre-tournament favorites before injuries to reigning Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas and all-time top goalscorer Jennifer Hermoso rocked their preparation. Jorge Vilda's side suffered their first defeat since 2019 to Germany in the group stage, but even in that game dominated possession of the ball. Spain's ability to keep the ball off the hosts frustrated England and another sellout crowd of 29,000 in Brighton for the vast majority of the first 90 minutes. But they again struggled to turn their possession into goals. England have not lost in the 18 games since Wiegman took charge in September. The Spaniards have yet to win a knockout game in a major tournament. (With input from agencies)
