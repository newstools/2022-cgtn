Police have killed Jayland Walker, a Black man in Ohio, by shooting him dozens of times as he ran from officers following a traffic violations, a lawyer for his family said on Sunday. The incident happened just weeks after a racist attack at a Buffalo supermarket by a white gunman who killed 10 Black shoppers. Two years ago, the killing of George Floyd by a white policeman revealed the dramatic extent to which systemic racism imbues law enforcement, the criminal justice system and some U.S. communities. Two years after Floyd's death and the racial justice movement that followed, do Black lives really matter in the U.S. now?
