More than 100 pro-choice activists gathered outside the U.S. Supreme Court on Independence Day to condemn its overturning of the constitutionally protected right to abortion. An AP-NORC survey released last week indicates that 85 percent of American adults believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. When asked "Are you proud of the country today?" in a Fox News poll, less than 40 percent of voters said "yes," down 12 points from 2017 and 30 points from 2011.
