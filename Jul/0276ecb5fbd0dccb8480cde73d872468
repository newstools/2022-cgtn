U.S. President Joe Biden has tested positive for COVID-19 and is experiencing "very mild symptoms," the White House said on Thursday. The president was fully vaccinated and has received two COVID-19 booster shots. He has begun taking Paxlovid and will isolate at the White House and continue to carry out all of his duties fully during that time, the White House said. Biden has been in contact with members of the White House staff by phone this morning and will participate in his planned meetings at the White House this morning via phone and Zoom from the residence.
