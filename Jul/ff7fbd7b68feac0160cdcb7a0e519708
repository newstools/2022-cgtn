Zhou Guanyu of China and Alfa Romeo shared on social media on Thursday that he would be attending the F1 Austrian Grand Prix this weekend after he passed the medical examination following a scary crash he had last week at Silverstone. "Finished the final medical check, all good to go!" Zhou wrote on both Twitter and China's Twitter-like platform, Weibo. Zhou went into a dramatic high-speed shunt on Lap 1 of last Sunday's British Grand Prix. Tagged by Mercedes' George Russell just after the start, Zhou's car flipped and skidded upside down along the tarmac and gravel at high speed, with the force of the impact seeing the Alfa Romeo vault the outer barrier and come to rest against the inner catch fencing. "I'm OK, all clear. Halo saved me today. Thanks everyone for your kind messages!" Zhou later wrote on both platforms after the horror. The halo device was introduced in 2018 to protect drivers' heads, and despite initial criticism of its aesthetics from some quarters, it has since been widely credited for helping to prevent several serious injuries.
