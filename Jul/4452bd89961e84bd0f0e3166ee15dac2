Germany's bid to win a record ninth European Championship got off to an emphatic start as they beat Denmark 4-0 in their Group B opener in London on Friday. An early strike from Lina Magull and second-half goals from Lea Schuller, Lena Lattwein and Alexandra Popp ensured Germany kept their record intact of never losing an opening match in the Euros. In another group match, favorites Spain came from behind to beat Finland 4-1. Linda Sallstrom gave underdogs Finland a surprise lead in the first minute but Spain bounced back with headers from captain Irene Paredes, midfielder Aitana Bonmati and forward Lucia Garcia. Mariona Caldentey rounded off the scoring with a penalty for Spain, who are playing without their all-time top scorer Jennifer Hermoso and Ballon d'Or winner Alexia Putellas, who were both injured before the tournament. "They scored a goal inside the first minute of the game that nobody expected; we are not used to it," player of the match Bonmati told a news conference. "The good thing today is that we were able to get back in the game after the week we had been having, which has not been easy mentally. That's how a great team is made, in such moments. Denmark next take on Finland on Tuesday, while Germany play Spain later in the day. (With input from agencies)
