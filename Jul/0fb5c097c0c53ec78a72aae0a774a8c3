China's diving "Dream Team" continued to beat all-comers as Rio Olympic champion Ren Qian teamed up with 16-year-old Duan Yu to clinch top spot in the mixed 10-meter synchro final at the 2022 FINA World Championships in Budapest on Friday. Ren and Duan plunged into an early lead with a perfectly synchronized back dive pike and never took their feet off the pedal, scoring 341.16 points to win China's 10th diving gold medal at the Duna Arena. The result means China have swept all golds in the mixed 10m synchro since the event debuted at the 2015 world championships in Russia. Friday's triumph held special meaning for Ren, who also came out on top in this event at the same arena during the 2017 championships. "Not everyone gets a chance for a comeback," beamed the 21-year-old. "I am really happy about this victory, and incredibly honored." There was daylight between the Chinese duo and the rest as Ukraine's Sofia Lyskun and Oleksii Sereda finished a distant second with 317.01, a mere 1.11 points ahead of third-placed U.S. pair Delaney Schnell and Carson Tyler. Despite their failure to end China's winning streak, Lyskun and Sereda managed to add their names to the history books after bagging Ukraine's first ever medal in the event at the world championships. "We did not expect this," said Sereda, who was still digesting their unlikely triumph. "Honestly, we did not train mixed that much. We were thinking about fifth or sixth place, so the second place is amazing."
