2022 marks the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) is part of China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA). The GBA comprises nine cities in Guangdong Province and China's two SARs of Hong Kong and Macao. The strategic positioning of the GBA's development is to be innovation-driven. CGTN and the Hong Kong X Foundation are proud to present "InnoBay 2022" on Tuesday, a special program dedicated to helping viewers worldwide better understand the innovation potential of the GBA and Hong Kong. 2022 is the second year that CGTN is bringing you an in-depth look at how Hong Kong is transforming into a global hub for innovation and cutting-edge technology. "InnoBay 2022" continues CGTN's 360-degree look at how synergies within the GBA will propel the region, and Hong Kong, into the top echelon of global innovation and technology (I&T). CGTN hears from leading policymakers, scientists, investors and young entrepreneurs to get their take on the massive opportunities in the region and more. Key speakers include Leung Chun-Ying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), John Lee, the current chief executive of the HKSAR, Shen Haixiong, president of CMG, and Dr. Tan Tieniu, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR.
