Five people were killed and 49 others injured after a magnitude-6.1 earthquake struck early on Saturday in southern Iran, followed by two other strong quakes, state media outlet IRNA reported. IRNA said a magnitude-6.3 earthquake and a magnitude-6.1 quake followed the first one that flattened the village of Sayeh Khosh near Iran's Gulf coast. There were more than a dozen aftershocks. "Rescue work has been carried out and we are now providing tents as emergency housing," Mehrdad Hassanzadeh, head of emergency management in Hormozgan Province, told state TV.
