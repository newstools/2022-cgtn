For generations, local farmers living near the Babusha Desert in Gansu Province have committed to anti-desertification efforts, preventing further spread of sand dunes. This all started when a group of men, known as the Six Old Men dedicated their lives to the cause. Alongside their children and grandchildren, these trailblazers have turned more than 25,000 hectares of desert, into a green landscape. CGTN's Omar Khan traveled to Gansu Province to hear their stories and experience the work they do to this very day.
