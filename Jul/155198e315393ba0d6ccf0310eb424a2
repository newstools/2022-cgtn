Sri Lanka is suffering from its worst economic paralysis in seven decades. Protests have been on for months over dissatisfaction with the government's mismanagement of the economy that has sparked severe inflation, power outages and shortages of fuel and essential goods. On July 9, protesters stormed the presidential and prime minister's offices, demanding their resignation. The protesters who "occupied" the Sri Lankan Presidential Palace speak to a CGTN stringer about why they are protesting, the current hardship caused by the "bankruptcy" of the country and where they see Sri Lanka heading.
