China has constructed its first unmanned offshore oil platform at Enping Oilfield in the South China Sea, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation announced on July 13. The platform, named EP10-2, does not have any offices or living quarters. Hence, it's much cheaper to build and maintain, enabling oil companies to drill fields that are not cost-effective enough for traditional rigs. Its deck size is reduced to half, and its total weight is only one-third of the traditional platforms. It can also work under extreme conditions like typhoons since it is mostly remote-controlled.
