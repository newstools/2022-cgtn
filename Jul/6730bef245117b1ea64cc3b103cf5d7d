Xiaoshu, also known as "Minor Heat", is the 11th solar term of the year and the fifth solar term of the summer. This year's Xiaoshu falls on July 7. Many might have the misunderstanding of Xiaoshu's name, which describes the heat (shu) with the adjective minor (xiao). In fact, the name is related to the three consecutive periods during the hot season which are called "Fu" in Chinese, meaning the heat would make people want to lie down. As the first "Fu" period is relatively cooler, therefore the solar term during this period is called "Minor Heat," and the next one is called "Major Heat" – hot, but not the hottest yet. During Xiaoshu, thunderstorms and rainfall are quite frequent. Besides, the "plum rain" season which has been continued in the lower stretches areas of the Yangtze River will linger for a few days. The animals representing Xiaoshu are the crickets and eagles. According to the three pentads of Xiaoshu, crickets start to crawl from the field into the yard for shade and coolness, and young eagles that were hatched are ready to soar and learn to hunt.
