Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Wednesday said that he is ready to rebuild his governing coalition, after President Sergio Mattarella on July 14 rejected his resignation. In his speech to the Senate, Draghi said he was prepared to stay on as the prime minister if the parties in his broad coalition threw their weight back behind him. The Italian Senate will hold a confidence vote in Draghi's government on Wednesday, and another vote in the lower house is scheduled on Thursday.(With input from agencies)
