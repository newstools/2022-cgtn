Zhu Yaming of China secured qualification for the men's triple jump final by reaching 17.08 meters in his first attempt at the World Athletics Championships in Eugene, Oregon on Thursday. The qualification performance for the final is 17.05 meters. Zhu ranked fourth among all of the 12 athletes that advanced to the final on Saturday. Pedro Pichardo of Portugal, who won the gold medal of the event at the Tokyo Olympics, performed the best at 17.16 meters. "I felt good. Making the final with only one jump helped me save a lot of strength,” Zhu told CGTN. “I hope I could perform well in the final." He revealed that it was part of his pre-match plan to go for the best in the first jump. "I think I have prepared well enough by now. All I am looking forward to is to compete in the final. I will spare no efforts and to my best in the final," Zhu added. Two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time World Championships winner Christine Taylor of the U.S. failed to reach the final after reaching only 16.48 meters for the best with three attempts. "Taylor is my hero. I used to train with him," Zhu said. "He is not in the best form because of injuries, but he loves triple jump so much. I admire his efforts to come back to the field." There were three Chinese athletes, including Zhu, planning to appear in the men's triple jump event in Eugene, but Wu Ruiting had to quit due to injury before the World Championships began. Fang Yaoqing didn't participate in Thursday's competitions after feeling sick in the morning. "I know how they felt," Zhu said. "It's a pity to withdraw from a major international tournament like this." Zhu revealed that he went through some difficulties, both physically and mentally, during his preparations for the World Championships, but he managed to overcome them a month before the tournament began. "I have been seeking my best, smoothest jump for years but couldn't find it," Zhu told reporters. "I will do my best to find it this time in the final."
