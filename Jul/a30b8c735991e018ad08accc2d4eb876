The Biden administration on Monday said doctors and hospitals need to follow federal law and provide abortions if there is a medical emergency and the health or life of the patient is at risk, regardless of state law. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) announced new guidance on Monday to ensure that pregnant women can access emergency medical care afforded under the law. HHS reaffirmed that it protects providers when offering legally-mandated, life- or health-saving abortion services in emergency situations under the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (EMTALA).
