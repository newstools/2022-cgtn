The death toll from flooding in eastern Kentucky, the U.S. state, has risen to at least 25, local media reported on Saturday. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear has previously warned that the toll was "going to get a lot higher" and would include children. President Joe Biden has approved a disaster declaration, announcing federal funding is available to assist in recovery efforts. Beshear has declared a state of emergency.
