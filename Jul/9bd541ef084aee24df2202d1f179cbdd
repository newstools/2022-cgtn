The launch ceremony of the 5th Sichuan Opera Festival was held on Wednesday at the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Company. Sichuan opera artists from both Chongqing and Sichuan are gathering in the "mountain city" to present an artistic feast of Sichuan opera to their fans. The main activities of this year's Sichuan Opera Festival will last for 15 days, and an online exhibition of Sichuan opera three-dimensional video art will continue until September. Sichuan opera, a national intangible cultural heritage, is the typical local drama of Sichuan and Chongqing. The theme of this year's festival is "break the circle," that is, to break through from the niche opera circle and expand to the mainstream. On Friday, a flash mob parade of the 5th Sichuan Opera Festival came to the ancient lanes of Yuzhong District, Chongqing. In the ancient winding lanes, accompanied by gongs and drums, Sichuan opera performers put on face-changing, fire-breathing and other Sichuan opera stunts. Turning a corner on the intricate streets, the public may be surprised to find Sichuan opera performers doing a "flash mob" performance. The flash mob allows traditional Sichuan opera to reach out from the theater to the public, bringing a striking and captivating view.
