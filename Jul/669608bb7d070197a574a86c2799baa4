The British government has tabled a vote of confidence in itself, scheduled next week, after blocking an effort to bring one by the opposition Labour Party after ministers objected to its wording, the British media reported on Wednesday. "Labour were given the option to table a straightforward vote of no confidence in the government in keeping with contention, however they chose not to," said a spokesperson for the government. The vote will "give the House the opportunity to decide if it has confidence in the government," the spokesperson added.
