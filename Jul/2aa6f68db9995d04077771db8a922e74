John Lee, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), said on Saturday that the HKSAR government will spare no effort to promote patriotism education in Hong Kong. Lee made the remarks on Saturday during the 2022 Hong Kong Patriotism Education Summit Forum and the launch ceremony for the Patriotism Education Support Centre at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre. In the past, some people colluded with external forces and deliberately misled the youth and stigmatized national education, Lee said. He vowed that the HKSAR government will strive to promote patriotism and foster the sense of national identity among the youth. The HKSAR government needs to improve the national education system in order to ensure long-term prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and the steady development of "One Country, Two Systems," he said. The youth are the future of Hong Kong and successors to "One Country, Two Systems," he said, stressing the need to foster their sense of the nation and national identity from an early age.
