England won Wednesday's opening game 1-0 in front of a record European Championships crowd at Old Trafford, through a Beth Mead effort which was confirmed via goal-line technology. The tournament hosts will travel to the country's south coast next to face Norway in Brighton with Martin Sjogren's team coming off the back of a 4-1 thrashing of Northern Ireland on Thursday. England's record goalscorer Ellen White is hoping the Lionesses can be more clinical in front of goal when they play a potential Group A decider against Norway on Monday. "Our main priority was three points, obviously. And yes, there's things that we could definitely improve on and we're looking to improve on going into the game on Monday. But it was all about the three points." White is also keen to make her mark on the scoreboard, having not put the ball into the net since April. The 50-goal forward missed two of England's warm-up games with COVID-19 and was looking forward to the game against Norway. "We watched it, we've analyzed it and we're fully focused on what we can do on Monday. And yeah, we're excited, it's a big, big game for us and we're excited for Monday."
