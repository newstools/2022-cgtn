China's National Health Commission on Friday published a technical guideline on monkeypox prevention and control. It stated that apart from the virus testing for COVID-19, people entering China should also be screened for monkeypox virus during quarantine, especially those who have a history of travel to countries where monkeypox has been reported 21 days before entering China.
