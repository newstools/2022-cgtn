Argentine winger Angel Di Maris has joined Juventus as a free agent, the Serie A powerhouses announced on Friday. "Never known to hold back, he gives it everything he's got: talent, acceleration, toil, commitment, class, charisma – and, of course, heart, as he shows the world every time he celebrates. He is Angel Di Maria. And he is a Juventus player," Juventus said in a statement. Di Maria has played for three heavyweights, Real Madrid, Manchester United and Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) in the previous 12 seasons, winning one La Liga and five Ligue 1 titles, two Copa del Rey and five Coupe de France championships as well as one UEFA Champions League title. "A world-class forward, capable of scoring exceptional goals, but also able to coordinate the entire frontline, often sending his teammates through on goal. In recent years in the Champions League, with 22 goals and 32 assists, he has taken part in more goals than any other player," Juventus said of Di Maria in the statement. Though Di Maria is not as fast as he used to be, he can still be counted on to dictate offensive play. He had 131 assists in the Champions League, the third-most since 2010 of the top five leagues, behind only Thomas Muller and Lionel Messi. Before Di Maria, Juventus had already signed back Paul Pogba who became a free agent after completing his contract with United. The club have lost Paulo Dybala and thus need enhancements in the offensive line. Meanwhile, Juventus are battling to keep world's top defender Matthijs de Ligt, or at least sell him in the best deal. Bayern Munich have reportedly offered as much as 90 million euros (about $91.7 million) for him. Juventus finished the 2021-22 season with 20 wins, 10 draws and eight losses, ranking fourth on the table after a slow, poor start.
