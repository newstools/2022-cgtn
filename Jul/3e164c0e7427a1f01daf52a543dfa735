Bangladesh has asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to start negotiations for a loan, but the macroeconomic situation is "no way in trouble," a local newspaper reported on Wednesday, quoting Finance Minister AHM Mustafa Kamal. "The IMF was requested to start a formal negotiation to obtain loans for balance of payments and budget assistance," Kamal said, adding that he hoped to see an IMF mission. (With input from Reuters)
