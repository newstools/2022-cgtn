Chinese diver Chen Yiwen took China's 11th gold medal in women's 3-meter springboard at the ongoing FINA World Championships in Budapest on Saturday. The 23-year-old led throughout the final, hitting 366.90 points to win, ahead of Canada's Mia Vallee. Another Chinese diver Chang Yani moved up from fifth place to win the bronze with a flawless last dive that earned her 72 points and a total of 325.85 from five rounds. "It was the penultimate day of the tournament, and all of my teammates had won the golds in the previous events, so it gave me some pressure going into the final today," said Chen, who won her first worlds gold in 1m springboard three years ago in Gwangju, South Korea. "I'm not satisfied with my performance today; it was not the normal level of my dives. I was so nervous in the competition, and I should improve my mentality when facing such big tournaments," said 20-year-old Chang. "In the second and fourth rounds, I made some errors." Team China is only two steps away from sweeping all diving gold medals at the Championships, with two finals to be staged on Sunday. Chen and Chang will partner in the women's 3m springboard synchronized, while Yang Hao and Yang Jian are leading in the final of the men's 10m platform. (With input from Xinhua)
