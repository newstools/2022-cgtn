Former UK Finance Minister Rishi Sunak says he is running to replace Boris Johnson. Friday's announcement comes three days after Sunak helped launch the cascade of resignations. Boris Johnson resigned as leader of the Conservative Party, however he will remain in office as prime minister until a new party leader is chosen. Conservative Party members normally get to choose between the two final candidates. A member opinion poll puts Sunak in front at 25 percent, ahead of Foreign Secretary Liz Truss at 21 percent.
