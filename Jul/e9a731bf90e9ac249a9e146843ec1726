Former Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa is set to extend his stay in Singapore, according to the Straits Times. The report said Rajapaksa's short-term visit pass, which was issued when he arrived in Singapore on a private visit two weeks ago, has been extended by another 14 days. Rajapaksa will return to his country from Singapore, said Bandula Gunewardena, spokesperson for the Sri Lankan government cabinet, on Tuesday.
