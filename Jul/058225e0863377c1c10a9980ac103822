The second stage of the 2022 Chinese Super League (CSL) season will begin on August 5, and 11 of the 18 teams will return to their home to play, the Chinese Football Association (CFA) announced on Saturday. The 2022 CSL season took a break after the first 10 rounds were finished, and the CFA had said in early July that it wanted to bring football games back to the teams' home stadiums after the competition had been concentrated in certain cities for three years. However, as COVID-19 continues to spread in the country, not all teams can reach an agreement with their home cities to play and host visiting teams at home. The CFA allowed those teams to either use stadiums in other cities as their home ground or be concentrated in one city like before. The 11 teams that will play in their home cities are Shandong Taishan, Guangzhou, Changchun Yatai, Guangzhou City, Henan Songshan Longmen, Wuhan Changjiang, Wuhan Three Towns, Meizhou Hakka, Zhejiang Professional, Chengdu Rongcheng and Dalian Professional. The two teams based in east China's Shanghai Municipality, Shanghai Port and Shanghai Shenhua, will use two stadiums in Dalian, northeast China's Liaoning Province as their home fields. The rest five teams, Beijing Guoan, Shenzhen, Hebei, Cangzhou Mighty Lions and Tianjin Jinmen Tiger, will be concentrated in Haikou, south China's Hainan Province for the second stage of the competition. The second stage will run from August 5 and December 18, and the cities are encouraged to open the games to spectators. Wuhan Three Towns remained undefeated with nine wins and one draw after the first stage to lead the CSL table with 28 points. They were followed by Shandong Taishan with 24 points, Henan Songshan Longmen with 23 points and Shanghai Shenhua with 21 points.
