Chinese striker Zhang Linyan has joined Grasshopper Club Zurich women's team in the Swiss Women's Super League, the club announced on Friday. Zhang, who was playing for Wuhan Jianghan University in the Chinese Women's Super League (CWSL) previously, arrived at Grasshopper on loan and will play for her new team in the 2022-23 season. Zhang has scored six goals in 10 games for Wuhan this season, ranking second on the scorers' table. She has also made seven appearances for the Chinese national team, including playing in the Asian Cup Final against South Korea in February. She scored her first goal for the franchise in that game, helping China beat the opponents 3-2 to win the title. "I want to thank Wuhan for the support they gave me to play overseas," Zhang said. "I hope I can grow as a player during my time in Grasshopper so I can make better contributions for the Chinese national team in the future." Chang Weiwei, manager of Wuhan, spoke highly of Zhang's ability to adapt to a new team quickly and finish off chances. Chang said she played a key role in the team's 10-game winning streak and wished her success in Switzerland. Lara Dickenmann, general manager of Grasshopper, welcomed Zhang's arrival to the club. She said she looked forward to Zhang's performance based on her excellent skills, speed, reading of the games and rich experience. Dickenmann also expressed her will to build closer cooperation with the Chinese national team. Li Lei, who joined Grasshopper's men's team in December 2021, sent a welcome to Zhang on Sina Weibo. Grasshopper finished the 2021-22 regular season with 12 wins, one draw and five losses. They reached the playoffs but lost to the eventual champions Zurich Frauen in the semifinals.
