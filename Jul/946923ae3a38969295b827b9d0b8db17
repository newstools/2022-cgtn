Schools of lenok, also known as Asiatic trout, swam against the current to spawn in Yangxian County, northwest China's Shaanxi Province.Wagging their tails vigorously, the fish moved upstream from a pond to the river via a waterfall at a scenic spot at the southern foothill of the Qinling Mountains.For optimal growth and reproduction, they require water temperatures that do not exceed 18 degrees Celsius. Their breeding season takes place from June to July. The species, with the scientific name of Brachymystax lenok tsinlingensis, is under second-class state protection.
