The Jiangsu section of China's Baihetan-Jiangsu ultra-high-voltage direct current (UHVDC) power transmission project was completed in eastern China in July. With its transmission line stretching about 2,080 km, the project transmits clean hydropower from the southwestern province of Sichuan to east China's economic powerhouse Jiangsu Province. According to the State Grid Corporation of China, it is the world's first UHVDC power transmission project using a new approach that combines the conventional direct current and flexible direct current technologies.
