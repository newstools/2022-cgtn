Torrential rain lashed war-torn Yemen's capital and its environs Sunday, causing flooding and a building collapse that killed an overall 10 people, including four children, authorities said. The four children were killed in the building collapse, while another six people died when their car was swept away by floods in a district near Sanaa, according to officials. Heavy rains cause devastating flooding in Yemen each year, and the latest torrents have been building up over the past week.
