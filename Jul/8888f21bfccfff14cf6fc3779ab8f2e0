Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area in Songpan County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, has a large number of orchids. The area is known for its rich biodiversity. Due to the high ornamental and economic value of orchids, many wild orchids have been over-collected and their habitat has been destroyed, so most orchids have become rare and an endangered species. With years of environmental protection and artificial conservation, the orchids in Huanglong not only have a wide variety, but also form a sea of flowers. Forests, valleys and trails are all places where alpine orchids bloom.
