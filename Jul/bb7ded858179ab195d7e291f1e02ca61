Novak Djokovic came back from two sets down to beat 20-year-old Italian Jannik Sinner 5-7 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-2  in the last eight on Tuesday and set up a clash with Britain's surprise semi-finalist Cameron Norrie. The 35-year-old Serbian reached his 43rd Grand Slam semi-final and 11th at Wimbledon, extending an unbeaten run at the tournament that goes back to 2017 and now stands at 26 matches. After the match, Djokovic explained how he had turned it around. "The first two sets compared to the last three was like two different matches," Djokovic, who is now joint second all-time with Jimmy Connors on 83 Wimbledon match wins, said. "He (Sinner) was the better player for two sets, then I went out and had a toilet break and had a little pep talk with myself in the mirror, it's actually true." He added that "I broke early in the third set and that gave me a confidence boost and I saw a little doubt in him." Djokovic has not added to his 20 major titles this year after being deported before the Australian Open following a Covid-19 standoff and then losing to old adversary Rafael Nadal in the quarter-finals of the French Open. He might even be barred from the US Open over his decision to shun a COVID vaccine. Meanwhile, Norrie, who is the first British man to reach the Wimbledon semi-finals since Andy Murray in 2016, said he was going to "take it" to top seed Djokovic. Ninth seed Norrie came back to defeat the 58th-ranked Belgian, 3-6, 7-5, 2-6, 6-3, 7-5 to make the last four of a Slam for the first time. On the women's court, Tunisian third seed Ons Jabeur, the highest surviving seed in the women's draw, recovered from losing her first set at this year's Wimbledon to beat Czech Marie Bouzkova 3-6 6-1 6-1 and reach her maiden Grand Slam semi-final. Currently playing at her highest career ranking at second, Jabeur will meet the 103rd-ranked Tatjana Maria, who earlier beat fellow German Jule Niemeier, for a place in Saturday's final.
