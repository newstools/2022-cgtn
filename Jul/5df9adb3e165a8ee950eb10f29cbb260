The LEGOLAND Windsor Resort is supporting the England women's soccer team ahead of Sunday's European Championship final by building LEGO miniatures of the team. It took two model makers and 874 pieces to reproduce the famous players, among them captain Leah Williamson and stars Beth Mead and Lauren Hemp (the latter already a LEGO enthusiast).
