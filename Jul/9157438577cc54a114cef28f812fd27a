Thirteen scrap-metal collectors in northeast Nigeria's Borno state were killed when a bomb they excavated blew up, security sources told AFP on Tuesday. Sixteen metal scavengers from a displaced persons' camp in Bama found the bomb while digging for scrap on Monday in the bush on the outskirts of town. "The bomb exploded as they were pushing it in a cart toward the town, killing 13 and seriously injuring three," Babakura Kolo, a leader in a local anti-jihadist militia, said.
