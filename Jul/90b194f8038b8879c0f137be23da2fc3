China launched its solid carrier rocket Lijian-1 at 12:12 p.m. on Wednesday (Beijing Time), successfully sending six experimental scientific satellites into preset orbit. Developed by the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Lijian-1 lifted off from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China. The six satellites will focus on technology verification and experiments on new space technologies, orbital atmospheric density detection, low-orbit quantum key distribution and electromagnetic assembly testing.
