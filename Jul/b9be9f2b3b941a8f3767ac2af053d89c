German's Federal Network Agency chief Klaus Mueller says the Nord Stream 1 pipeline would resume at around 30 percent capacity. He said the gas flows could be changed upwards or cut further. The pipeline has been offline since July 11 due to planned maintenance. The capacity of the pipeline was cut to 40 percent prior to the maintenance.
