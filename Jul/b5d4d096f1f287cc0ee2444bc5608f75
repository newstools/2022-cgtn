Novak Djokovic, the 21-time Grand Slam champion, was given pride of place on a balcony at Belgrade City Hall, the day after his four-set victory over Nick Kyrgios in the Wimbledon men's final. On Monday, thousands of people waved Serbian flags and shouted 'Nole, Nole,' Djokovic's nickname in Serbian, as crowds gathered to acknowledge the 35-year-old's seventh Wimbledon title. Djokovic addressed the crowd from the balcony and threw 20 signed tennis balls into the crowd. (With input from AP)
