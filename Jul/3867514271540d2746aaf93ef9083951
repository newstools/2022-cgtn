Over 10 billion cubic meters of natural gas has so far been injected into Dazhangtuo, China's first underground commercial gas storage, Xinhua News Agency reported on Sunday. Located in the Binhai New Area, north China's Tianjin, Dazhangtuo was put into operation in 2000. It caters to the peak seasonal demand as well as emergency needs. It has delivered clean energy to Beijing and its surroundings for 22 years. "Ten billion cubic meters of natural gas is equivalent to an annual gas consumption of 50 million households," Wang Jian, a manager at the storage facility, told Xinhua. It is one of the 10 storage facilities in Dagang oilfield natural gas storage cluster owned by China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC), one of China's top three oil giants. With a total storage capacity of 7.68 billion cubic meters and working volume of 3.46 billion cubic meters, the cluster is expected to provide 2.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas during winter, CNPC told Xinhua. China's domestic gas output exceeded 200 billion cubic meters for the first time last year, and the target will be 230 billion cubic meters by 2025, the China Economic Weekly said, citing a report released by China's National Development and Reform Commission.
