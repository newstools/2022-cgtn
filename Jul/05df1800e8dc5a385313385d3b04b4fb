Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced multiple upcoming bilateral projects on a visit to Greece on Tuesday, including one for a power cable between the two countries to provide Europe with "cheaper renewable energy," AFP reported. The project would link electricity grids to "provide Greece and southwest Europe through Greece with... much cheaper renewable energy," Prince Mohammed said. The Greek foreign ministry said agreements on maritime transport, energy and defense technology, among others, are due to be signed on Wednesday.
