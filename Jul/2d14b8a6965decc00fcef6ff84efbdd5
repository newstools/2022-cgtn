"LA is an ambitious city of endless possibilities and the Games will reflect our community," said LA28 Chairperson Casey Wasserman in the statement, noting that Los Angeles will provide the perfect backdrop to host the biggest cultural, sporting and entertainment event in the world. Organizers said the LA28 Games will use existing world-class stadiums and sports venues across the Los Angeles region, ensuring a sustainable and fiscally responsible event. The LA28 Games will feature more than 3,000 hours of live sport across 800 events in more than 40 sports.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced in Lima, Peru on September 13, 2017, that Paris will hold the 2024 Olympic Games and gave 2028 to Los Angeles. The IOC decision has made both the two cities three-time Summer Olympics hosts as Paris hosted the games in 1900 and 1924 and Los Angeles hosted the games in 1932 and 1984.
