Summer is the best season to enjoy lotus as the aquatic plant has both aesthetic and cultural value, especially for the Chinese. During the Six Dynasties period (220-589), people extensively cultivated lotus and formed a custom of appreciating lotus in summer. Liang Hong, a photographer who has focused on lotuses for over 30 years, shares his latest photos of this year taken in Luoshan County, central China's Henan Province. Have a look!
