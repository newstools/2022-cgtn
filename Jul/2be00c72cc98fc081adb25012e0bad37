More global exhibitors will attend the second China International Consumer Products Expo later this month in Haikou, south China's Hainan Province, the Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) said on Thursday. The exhibition area for overseas businesses will account for 80 percent of the overall participation this year, increasing from last year's 75 percent, MOFCOM Spokesperson Shu Jueting told a regular news conference. The second expo, scheduled for July 26-30, will see an increase in the number of exhibiting businesses and brands from 58 countries and regions, according to Shu. Over 40,000 purchasers are estimated to attend the forthcoming expo, Shu said. The exhibition area will also be expanded from last year's 80,000 square meters to 100,000 square meters this year. Japanese, French and U.S. participants will each have an exhibition area of about 3,000 square meters. Members of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership will see their exhibition area increase by nearly 20 percent. "Through hosting consumption promotion activities like the expo, we aim to accelerate the recovery and sustained growth of the domestic consumer market and better leverage the role of consumption in driving economic growth," the spokesperson said. During the expo, overseas exhibits will enjoy tax-free policies for import and sales, and the categories of exhibits include furniture, clothing and accessories.
