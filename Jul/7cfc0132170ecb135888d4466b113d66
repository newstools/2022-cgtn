On Friday, Japan's Nuclear Regulation Authority (NRA) officially approved the Tokyo Electric Power Company (TEPCO)'s discharge plan for the treated Fukushima nuclear accident contaminated water. The water used to cool reactors in the aftermath of the 2011 nuclear disaster is being stored in huge tanks at the plant and amounted to more than 1.3 million tonnes by July. Residents held a protest rally outside the venue to oppose the dumping of polluted nuclear water into the ocean.
