Libyan protesters have rallied in the capital Tripoli as well as several other towns, calling for the removal of the current political class and for elections to be held. The protesters, frustrated by years of chaos and division, blocked roads and set tires ablaze on July 2. They also rallied against the nation's dire economic conditions, as prices for fuel and food have risen.
