French champions Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) have announced the signing of Nordi Mukiele from German outfit RB Leipzig. Hailing from Montreuil, the France defender made 146 appearances for Leipzig in all competitions and helped them reach the 2020 Champions League semifinals and win the German Cup last season, the club's first major trophy. He represented France at U18, U19, U20 and U21 levels, before earning his first full international cap for the senior team in the Qatar World Cup qualifier against Finland in September last year. "At twenty-four, the native of Montreuil is thus returning to France by committing until 2027 to Paris St Germain, finding a region he knows by heart and a club he has met several times," PSG said in a statement. Mukiele's arrival at PSG is the latest disappointment for Chelsea, who were also interested in the former Leipzig star. He becomes the third player to have snubbed the English giants this summer after both Raphinha and Jules Kounde were hijacked by Spanish powerhouses Barcelona. Meanwhile, West Ham United have fought off interest from a host of top clubs to complete the signing of promising Italy striker Gianluca Scamacca from Serie A club Sassuolo.  The 23-year-old joins the Premier League side on a five-year contract, with an option to extend for a further year. "I am really excited to join West Ham," said Scamacca, who scored 16 goals in 36 matches last season. "I've waited a long time for this moment – it's been a dream to play in the Premier League. "I feel like West Ham is the perfect team for me. They showed they really wanted me and when I spoke to the manager there was an instant understanding. I can't wait to play and show the supporters what I can do in the West Ham shirt – I hope we will love each other."
