Mali was expelling the spokesperson of the UN's peacekeeping force in the country over posts he made on Twitter, the foreign ministry said on Wednesday. MINUSMA spokesperson Olivier Salgado has been given 72 hours to leave over "tendentious and unacceptable" posts he made concerning a controversy involving Ivorian troops, the ministry mentioned in a statement received by AFP.
