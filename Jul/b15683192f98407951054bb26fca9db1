Protesters stormed the official residence of Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on July 9 shortly after he fled the Colombo compound. Huge crowds had surrounded the leader's home to demand his resignation, blaming government mismanagement for a painful economic downturn. Officials said that thousands of anti-government protesters ignored the stay-home order and even forced railway authorities to operate trains to take them to Colombo for Saturday's rally.
