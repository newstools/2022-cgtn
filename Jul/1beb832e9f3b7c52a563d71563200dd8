G20 finance ministers agreed on most issues, including efforts to tackle food insecurity, despite failing to reconcile differences regarding members' views about the war in Ukraine, Indonesia said on Saturday. In place of a formal communique would be a 14-paragraph statement issued by Indonesia, the G20 chair's Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said in closing remarks. She said there was consensus on most of the document but two paragraphs would focus on members' differences regarding the war's impacts and how to respond. "I think this is the best result," she said. (With input from Reuters and AFP)
