Danish police said Monday that the 22-year-old suspect in a weekend shooting at a Copenhagen mall that left three dead and four injured was known to mental health services. "Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment," Copenhagen police chief Soren Thomassen told a press conference. He also said that the victims appeared to have been randomly targeted in the attack on Sunday evening and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror.
