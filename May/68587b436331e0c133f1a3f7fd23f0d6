Sunday's Game 7 wasn't a typical loss for the Phoenix Suns. They were embarrassed and outclassed by Luka Doncic and the Dallas Mavericks from the beginning, but their 43-point loss to the Mavericks was a surprise. Frustrated Suns fans lamented their team's performance after the game, but some took things even further. A video of a Suns fan burning a Chris Paul jersey after Game 7 has gone viral on Twitter. Paul finished with just 10 points at the end of the game. The Suns made a run to the finals last year and finished this season with the best record in the NBA. To end such a strong run with a 40-point blowout loss to the Mavs in Game 7 isn't how anyone imagined it would go. Timberwolves guard Patrick Beverley criticized his rival's movements on the court just a few hours after Game 7. "He can't guard. He literally can't guard," Beverley told ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith on his show. The Wolves veteran then went on to compare Paul to an orange cone. But current and former NBA players are not taking his criticism lightly. Paul's former teammate and now ESPN analyst Matt Barnes has seemingly had enough of Beverley's antics. He stood up for the Suns' point guard in a recent segment. "There's a thin line between being critical and disrespecting," Barnes said during the show. Damian Lillard fired back on Twitter by forwarding Beverley's stats line during his short 2022 playoff run. "Cuz nobody guarding this man," Lillard wrote. Beverley also clapped back at Jeremy Lin for saying Chris Paul 'deserves' an NBA title. Former NBA point guard Lin reflected on Paul's larger body of work and tweeted that the 37-year-old "deserves" to taste victory in the NBA finals, but Beverley disagreed. "What u mean deserve why does he deserves it more?" he said on Twitter.
