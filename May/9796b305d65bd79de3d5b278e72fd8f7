A gunman opened fire at an elementary school in Texas on May 24, killing at least 19 students and two adults. It was the deadliest mass shooting since 2018. The 213 mass shootings so far this year average out to about 10 such attacks each week. A study published in the New England Journal Medicine in April shows that since 1999, guns overtook car crashes for the first time in 2020 as the leading cause of death for U.S. children and teenagers. Also, the data suggest that gun ownership has grown significantly over the last several years. That has exposed 11 million people to household firearms, including five million children.
