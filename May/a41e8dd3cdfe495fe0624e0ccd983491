U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday met with King Abdullah II of Jordan and discussed urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric and ease tensions in Israel and the West Bank, the White House said. "The leaders consulted on recent events in the region and discussed urgent mechanisms to stem violence, calm rhetoric and reduce tensions in Israel and the West Bank," the White House said in a statement. Tensions are high with a wave of anti-Israeli attacks that resulted in the deaths of at least 18 people since March 22. A total of 31 Palestinians and three Israeli Arabs have died during the same period, according to AFP. (With input from agencies)
