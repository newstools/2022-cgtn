At least 11 people were killed and dozens injured after a head-on collision between a van and a bus carrying as many as 45 passengers in Brazil's west-central state of Mato Grosso, which borders Bolivia, the Federal Highway Police said on Tuesday. The bus driver, who reportedly fell asleep at the wheel, is in serious condition, while the van driver suffered only minor injuries.
