Sunday witnessed two important events at two launch sites in China as the country gears up for missions to complete its space station by the end of the year. At the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest China, a Long March-2F carrier rocket with the Shenzhou-14 spacecraft was moved to the launch tower, ready for its mission scheduled in June. Meanwhile, a Long March-5B carrier rocket arrived at the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in the southern island of Hainan.
