Shanghai has been fighting a tough battle against COVID-19 in its worst outbreak in two years. While under the dynamic-zero COVID policy, a group of young people with an average age of just 22 worked hard to create Yituan GO, a group-buying website that allows people to shop online, as well as obtaining the most accurate and timely information for daily necessities. It was quickly launched after 24 hours, and soon reached more than 60,000 visits. On April 8, Zhang Yuyin, a teacher at Shanghai Xiancheng vocational training school, came up with the idea to build an information sharing website after seeing that many communities had trouble going out to buy food. Li Hui, the school's senior technician, quickly responded to this idea and began development. The website was purely for public good without earning any revenue from commercial use. Users can enter keywords into search engines to compare prices from each store. More than 2,600 pieces of information were collected from local authorities, and volunteers verify the specific source one by one. To help elderly, the website also has a speed-dial function, so that they can click the number on the page to immediately dial relevant departments or stores. The website is now being constantly developed and updated. The team has also been continuously expanded, starting with 4 people and now reaching 23. "Young people trapped at home also want to do something for Shanghai," Zhang wrote in an article on the website. "We tried our best to make this website go live as soon as possible to help more people. We are not paid in any way, but we love Shanghai, so we're all willing to do this."
