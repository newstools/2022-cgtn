Snow pigeons reside on cliffs at an altitude of 3,000 meters in Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China's Sichuan Province. As their name indicates, they are at home in snowy surroundings and can stand the cold temperatures near the snow line like snow partridges. Unlike other birds, they can suck water directly instead of having to tilt their heads to make water flow down throats. Snow pigeons often appear in groups and feed on grain, buds, shoots, berries and seeds. As night falls, they fly back to the cliffs and roost there.
