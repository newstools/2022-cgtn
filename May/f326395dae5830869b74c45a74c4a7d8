Factors like geopolitical tensions and sky-high inflation will impact the Chinese economy in the second quarter this year, said Alessandro Golombiewski Teixeira, former chief economic adviser to the Brazilian president and professor of Tsinghua University. However, he said China's "unified domestic market" strategy sends a positive message to the international business communities. He also said that BRICS economies need to find ways to help build resilience for the global economic recovery against the backdrop of downgraded global growth forecasts by international institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank.
