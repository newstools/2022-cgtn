China has constructed the world's largest mobile broadband and fiber optic network with network quality reaching the world's top level, a senior Chinese official said on Tuesday, World Telecommunication and Information Society Day. "Fixed broadband has been upgraded from 100 megabits per second to 1,000 megabits per second, and the proportion of optical fiber users has increased from less than 10 percent in 2012 to 94.3 percent in 2021," Zhang Yunming, vice minister of industry and information technology, said. In addition, China has built nearly 1.6 million 5G base stations across the country, accounting for over 60 percent of the global total, making China the first in the world to set a large-scale 5G network based on an independent networking mode, Zhang added.
