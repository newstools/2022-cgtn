A red squirrel holds her baby in her mouth as she carries it up a tree to safety. The mother was spotted carrying the kit into a hole where they would be able to rest away from predators. John McRobbie, a photographer from Abernethy, Scotland, captured the scene while out for a walk with his camera around Loch Leven, a large lowland loch in Scotland. （All photos via CFP) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
