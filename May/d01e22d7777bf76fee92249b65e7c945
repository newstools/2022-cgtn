Russia has announced the expulsion of 85 diplomats from France, Spain and Italy. Moscow has declared the diplomats "personae non grata" after summoning ambassadors from the three countries in protest against their decisions to expel Russian diplomats. The Russian Foreign Ministry said the moves of France, Spain, and Italy will seriously damage bilateral relations. The diplomats will be asked to leave Russia within the next one to two weeks.
