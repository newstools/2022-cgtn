Twenty-four civilians were killed and around 60 wounded by separatist gunmen in a troubled anglophone region of Cameroon over the weekend, a local mayor said on Tuesday. The attack by separatists occurred on Sunday in the village of Obonyi II in the country's southwest region near the border with Nigeria, mayor Ekwalle Martin told AFP.
