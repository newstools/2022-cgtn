An online concert by Lo Tayu, one of the most known faces of Mandopop, attracted some 40 million viewers on Friday night, offering audiences an extra dose of nostalgia with some of the singer's best '80s and '90s hits. The no-frills event, themed around childhood – which is also the title of one of Lo's most beloved songs, saw the singer sitting on a lawn in a white T-shirt and strumming his guitar as he treated viewers to a medley of songs from his expansive repertoire. When asked why he chose childhood as the central theme of the concert, Lo told the Chinese newspaper The Paper, "The song 'Childhood' is in fact written for grownups." "Childhood is the starting point for everyone's growth, and it is also the purest memory in everyone's life. By naming this concert after our childhood, I hope that we, who have grown up, are struggling or are a little confused with life, can take a breath and find our original aspirations," Lo explained. The 68-year-old entertainer sang about growth, love and family on Friday, going for many of his golden hits, like "Proverbs of Love," "Dream," "Childhood" and "Love Song 1990." By 11:50 p.m., more than 41 million people had tuned in to the live broadcast, which also received over 83 million likes, according to The Paper. Lo was born in Taipei in China's Taiwan island and succeeded in capturing the hearts of millions of fans through bold songs that touched on political and social issues.
