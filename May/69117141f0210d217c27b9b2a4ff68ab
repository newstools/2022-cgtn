Hungarian Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Peter Szijjarto had an exclusive interview with China Media Group (CMG) on Thursday. Szijjarto said that if Hungary bans the import of Russian crude oil, Hungary's economy will be devastated. 65 percent of the country's oil supply comes from Russia, Szijjarto said. He pointed out that Hungary feels a lot of pressure from other EU countries to give consent to ban Russian oil.
