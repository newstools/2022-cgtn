The European Council and Parliament on Thursday provisionally agreed new rules on gas storage, aiming to ensure that storage capacities in the EU are filled before the winter season. Underground gas storage on member states’ territory should be filled to at least 80% of their capacity before next winter, according to a statement on the EU Council’s official website.
