China's women's team have entered quarterfinals following two consecutive wins in the group after sweeping Spanish counterparts 5-0 at the ongoing BWF Thomas and Uber Cup in Bangkok, Thailand on Monday. In the opener, Team China were in the perfect form to beat Australia 5-0. With the absence of world champion and former world No. 1 Carolina Marin, the Spanish team did not make too much trouble for Chinese shuttlers to advance during the game. In the singles, Chen Yufei defeated Clara Azurmendi 21-16, 23-21 in an intense game. All the other four games finished within half an hour. He Bingjiao shattered 18-year-old Lucia Rodriguez 21-2, 21-8 in only 24 minutes. Newly crowned at Badminton Asia Championships, Wang Zhiyi outclassed her rival Ania Setien 21-10, 21-6. In the doubles, Tokyo Olympic silver medalists Chen Qingchen/Jia Yifan swept Beatriz Corrales/Lorena Usle 21-9, 21-9. Meanwhile, another pair Du Yue/Li Wenmei won over Lucia Rodriguez/Ania Setien 21-5, 21-12. In the same group, Chinese Taipei beat Australia 5-0, and Denmark swept Egypt 5-0.  Team China will next face Chinese Taipei in the group stage. As reigning champion, China is a gold favorite at the tournament, with a total of 15 gold medals in history. China beat Japan 3-1 last year in Denmark.
