Tens of thousands of Israeli people marched through and around Jerusalem’s Old City on Sunday afternoon to mark Jerusalem Day. Some of them clashed with Palestinians and police. At least 60 people were detained for violence, Israeli media reported citing the police. Five Israeli police officers, three Israelis and 40 Palestinians were wounded. Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett on Sunday called on those taking part in the afternoon march to behave responsibly as he wished Israelis a happy Jerusalem Day.
