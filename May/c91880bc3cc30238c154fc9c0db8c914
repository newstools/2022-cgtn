Professional tennis players will not receive ATP and WTA ranking points at this year's Wimbledon Championships following the decision to ban Russian and Belarusian competitors from the tournament. The ATP announced the move in a statement on Friday, saying: "The ability for players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to our tour." Wimbledon organizers, the All England Lawn Tennis Club (AELTC), announced in April that Russian and Belarusian players would not be invited to this season's tournament because of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. That stance was mirrored by the UK's Lawn Tennis Association (LTA), effectively barring Russian stars such as men's world number two Daniil Medvedev from any tournaments on British soil this summer. "The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system." ATP added on its website. However, events outside of Wimbledon, such as Queen's and Eastbourne, will retain their ranking points. The 2022 Wimbledon Championships will run from June 27 to July 10.
