Six people were killed and five wounded on Monday in attacks by Islamic State militants in Kirkuk and Diyala provinces, according to local sources. In the northern province of Kirkuk, IS militants took advantage of a dust storm that swept through much of Iraq earlier in the day, and set fire to a wheat farm outside the provincial capital.
