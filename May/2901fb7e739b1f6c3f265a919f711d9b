Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) of Ligue 1 are likely to appoint Luis Campos to succeed Leonardo as their new sporting director, ESPN reported on Sunday. PSG celebrated winning the 2021-22 Ligue 1 title at Parc des Princes after a 5-0 win over Metz on May 21. Leonardo was not spotted at the ceremony and he was reportedly relieved of his duties after another disappointing season for the French powerhouse. The removal of the 52-year-old Brazilian is one of the conditions for Kylian Mbappe to sign a three-year contract extension with PSG, according to Le Parisien. The team's manager Mauricio Pochettino will have to go as well for the same reason. Campos built the franchise around Mbappe in Monaco to win the Ligue 1 title in the 2016-17 season. After that, the Portuguese joined LOSC Lille and spent the following three years turning the club into another championship franchise that won the French domestic league title in the 2020-21 season. Not only is Campos a brilliant director, he also maintains a great relationship with Mbappe and the 23-year-old French star's family. He was working as strategic advisor at Celta de Vigo in La Liga after leaving Lille while waiting for summoning from heavyweight clubs like PSG. According to ESPN, the negotiations between Campos and PSG went well on Sunday. An agreement may be announced on May 23. Campos will have a lot of work to do when he takes over the French giants. His first major task is to find a new manager for the club, which has put Zinedine Zidane top on their list of targets after he led Real Madrid to three consecutive UEFA Champions League titles between 2015 and 2018. PSG's squad could use an upgrade as well. ESPN revealed that they are looking at Ousmane Dembele and Frenkie de Jong of Barcelona, Aurelien Tchouameni of Monaco and Renato Sanches of Lille to enhance the club's midfield.
