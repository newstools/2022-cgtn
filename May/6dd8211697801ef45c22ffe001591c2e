A kitchen in Shanghai's Baoshan District were responsible for supplying food to a temporary hospital and two isolation sites amid the recent COVID-19 outbreak. Over the last two months, the head chef Ye Yinpo and his colleagues often worked from around 3 a.m. to 9 p.m., without a day's rest, processing more than 10,000 meals per day. The number of confirmed cases in Shanghai is decreasing every day and the community is gradually returning to normal.
