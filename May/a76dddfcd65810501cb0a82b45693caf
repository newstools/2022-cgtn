The Iraqi Joint Operations Command said two Katyusha rockets hit Ayn al-Asad Air Base, which houses U.S. military experts and agencies, on Saturday in Anbar Province, 160 kilometers west of Baghdad. No casualties were reported, the Command's media office said in a statement. It was unclear who was behind the attack. Ahmed al-Dulaimi, a colonel from Anbar Operations Command, told Xinhua that Iraqi forces had found two rocket launchers several kilometers from the air base and the incident was under investigation. The security situation in Iraq has improved since Iraqi forces defeated the Islamic State (IS）militant group in 2017. However, IS remnants have since melted into urban centers, deserts and rugged areas, carrying out frequent guerilla attacks against security forces and civilians. In two other security incidents on Saturday, an Iraqi soldier was killed and another injured in a roadside bomb explosion on the highway near Trebil Border Crossing with Jordan, while in the eastern province of Diyala, six mortar rounds hit a village, wounding a woman and damaging several houses and cars, according to official sources. Over the past few months, Iraqi security forces have carried out attacks against the extremist militants to crack down on their intensified activities.
