With Liverpool in contention for the Premier League and Champions League in the next seven days, manager Jurgen Klopp has said it is the most exciting period of his career so far. Liverpool are one point behind Manchester City in the league table ahead of the final round of fixtures and face Real Madrid in the final of the Champions League in Paris on Saturday. "Yes, it's the most exciting, definitely. Because seeing where we are and seeing how good the boys are, seeing the steps we've made, with two games to go, it's only one now I know, but with two games to go it's unbelievable, it feels like five minutes ago it was seven games. That's how it is. It's just like, bang, now here we go two finals. Really two finals, we've been playing finals for ages but now really two finals. It's massive. It's absolutely massive. It's the most exciting time of my career." said Klopp. (With input from AP)
