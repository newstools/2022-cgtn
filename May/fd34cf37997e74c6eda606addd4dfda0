China's first satellite-carried bipolar ocean survey payload supported by GNSS-R, a promising new remote sensing technique, was successfully sent into predetermined orbit, atop satellite Jilin-1 Kuanfu 01C together with seven other Jilin-1 Gaofen 03D satellites launched on Thursday from the Taiyuan Satellite Launch Center in north China's Shanxi Province. The Kuanfu 01C satellite-carried bipolar GNSS-R ocean survey payload has been mainly developed by Beijing Institute of Applied Meteorology. It is designed to take the L band signal of the navigation satellite as the transmitting source, and receive and process signals reflected from the ocean, land or moving objects obtained by a device installed on the satellite platform. In these cases, characteristic elements of the media and moving objects monitored by the payload can be extracted. It can provide important observation data such as the mean sea surface height, wave height, sea ice formation, sea surface wind field and sea salinity for global ocean exploration. Different from traditional unipolar survey, it can complete the detection and reception of two polarization modes of L band reflected signals simultaneously, and also improve the detection accuracy. The GNSS-R ocean survey payload can also provide all-weather and all-directional wind information on the sea surface and provide meteorological information for sailing ships. (Source: CCTV Plus)
