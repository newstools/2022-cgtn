What is the age range that defines the term "youth"? China's middle and long-term Youth Development Plan (2016-2025) defines it as persons between the ages of 14 and 35, but the United Nations makes it between 15 and 24. In fact, there is no universally accepted definition. So, are you young? It is not only the number that defines your age, but also the state of your life and mind. CGTN took to the streets to learn about Chinese definition of "youth" and young people's worries and dreams.
