U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi has arrived in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv and met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday. Pelosi has pledged continued U.S. support for Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden last week proposed a huge $33 billion package for arming and supporting Ukraine. Delivering remarks from the White House, Biden also proposed legislation to hold Russian oligarchs accountable for their alleged role in supporting the military operation, according to a separate factsheet by the White House detailing the proposal.
