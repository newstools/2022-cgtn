A group of Latin American countries meeting in Havana on Friday condemned the exclusion of certain nations from next month's Summit of the Americas. The United States will host the Summit of the Americas from June 6 to 10 in Los Angeles, and has said it will not invite the governments of Venezuela or Nicaragua. On the sidelines of the 21st Summit of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America-People's Trade Agreement (ALBA-TCP), the 10 countries bloc – including Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua – issued a statement criticizing the U.S. arrangement. They said they "reject the exclusions and discriminatory treatment at the so-called Summit of the Americas in Los Angeles." Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro said that in contrast to Washington's handling of the Americas Summit the ALBA-TCP is inclusive and uniting, and works on issues that impact people's lives and development in the region. "If there is anything truly democratic on this continent, it is ALBA, from the point of view of its debates and the sharing of diversity," Maduro said. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, along with the leaders of Bolivia and several other countries, has threatened to boycott the U.S.-hosted summit if certain countries are excluded. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said this week that he would not attend under "any circumstances" even if invited. (With input from Xinhua, Reuters)
