Weightlifting's governing body has announced several changes to qualifying for the 2024 Paris Olympics. The moves are aimed at streamlining the process and increasing the competitive level. The number of participants will be cut from 196 to 120, athletes will compete in five weight classes instead of seven, and each national or regional team will be limited to six participants in total. The categories won by China's Chen Lijun and Lyu Xiaojun have been removed, which means the two gold medalists must change divisions to participate in Paris. The International Weightlifting Federation's new system will rank participants based on scores from selected qualifying events, rather than total points from multiple competitions. Entrants must take part in at least five of the seven qualifiers, with the 2023 World Championships and 2024 World Cup both being mandatory. China's national team are currently training in Ningbo and assessing their best options.
