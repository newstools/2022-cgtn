Todd Boehly's proposed takeover of Chelsea moved a step closer to completion on Tuesday when the Premier League board announced it had approved his purchase of the London club. A consortium led by Boehly, a co-owner of baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, had already agreed to a deal worth 4.25 billion pounds ($5.3 billion) to buy the Premier League club from owner Roman Abramovich on May 7. "The Board has applied the Premier League's Owners' and Directors' Test (OADT) to all prospective directors, and undertaken the necessary due diligence," the league said in a statement. "Chelsea FC will now work with the relevant governments to secure the necessary licenses to complete the takeover." The proposal also needs approval from the British government before the consortium can complete the acquisition, with a week remaining before the club's current operating license expires on May 31. Earlier on Tuesday, a spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the government was working with the club over the deal. "We are working closely with Chelsea to progress the sale," the spokesman said. "We are holding intense discussions with the relevant international partners to get the necessary approvals and we will set out further details as soon as we can." The British government is set to approve the sale after Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich gave assurances he will not benefit from the deal, according to reports. (With input from agencies)
