The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is investigating two brands of organic strawberries sold at leading chain grocery stores for causing an outbreak of Hepatitis A, infecting 17 people so far, said the agency website. The FDA said it is "investigating a multi-state outbreak of Hepatitis A infections in the U.S. and Canada potentially linked to fresh organic strawberries brand FreshKampo and HEB" with several other health agencies. The infected strawberries were sold at retailers nationwide between March 5 and April 25, including Aldi, HEB, Kroger, Safeway, Sprouts Farmers Market, Trader Joe's, Walmart, Weis Market, and WinCo Foods. Although they should have passed shelf life by now, the FAD warned that people who froze those strawberries for later consumption should dispose of them immediately. Hepatitis A is a contagious virus that can cause liver disease, and its infection can range in severity from a mild illness lasting a few weeks to a severe illness lasting several months, according to FDA.
