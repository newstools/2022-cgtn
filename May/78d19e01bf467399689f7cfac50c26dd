Russia's Defense Ministry has reported that 50 civilians, including 11 children, were evacuated on Friday from the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol. The plant is the last Ukrainian holdout in the ruined city. The evacuees were handed over to United Nations and International Red Cross Committee representatives in Bezimenne, near the border with Russia. They will be transported to their preferred destinations. The ministry added that the humanitarian operation will resume on Saturday.
