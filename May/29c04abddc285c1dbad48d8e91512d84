The U.S. House of Representatives on Tuesday overwhelmingly passed a nearly $40 billion aid bill for Ukraine. The House passed the bill by 368 to 57, with all 'no' votes coming from Republicans. The measure now heads to the Senate, which is expected to act quickly within the coming days. Some Republicans opposed the Bill, criticising Democrats for moving too quickly to send too many U.S. taxpayer dollars abroad. Across the Capitol, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised the Senate "will move swiftly" to pass the package for U.S. President Joe Biden's signature. Biden asked Congress to approve an additional $33 billion in aid for Ukraine late last month, but lawmakers decided to add more military and humanitarian aid. "Time is of the essence, and we cannot afford to wait," House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said in a letter to House members before the vote. "This package, which builds on the robust support already secured by Congress, will be pivotal in helping Ukraine defend not only its nation but democracy for the world," she said. Meanwhile, the U.S. and its Western allies on Sunday announced new sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis. (With input from Reuters)
