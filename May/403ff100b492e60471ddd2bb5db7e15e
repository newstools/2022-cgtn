A Chinese mainland official on Thursday slammed a U.S. magazine for questioning the Communist Party of China (CPC)'s stance on the Taiwan region, calling the move "misleading" and having "evil intentions." "Taiwan is part of China, and that's a fact that won't change," said Zhu Fenglian, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council. The Diplomat, an American online news magazine, alleged that the CPC's position is "far from consistent" citing a lack of historical basis. Zhu refuted such comments, retraced Taiwan's history since decades ago and listed out the efforts the CPC has carried out since its founding. The CPC has always "regarded solving the Taiwan question and realizing China's complete reunification as its unswerving historical task," she said. Taiwan compatriots had "lived miserably" under Japan's colonial rule for 50 years after Japan's forcibly seizure in 1895, she pointed out. Although the both sides of the Taiwan Strait have yet to achieve reunification since 1949, the fact that the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China, has never changed, and that China's sovereignty and territory have never been divided, Zhu stressed. Zhu warned Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority and "Taiwan separatist forces" that the separatist activities are doomed to fail.
