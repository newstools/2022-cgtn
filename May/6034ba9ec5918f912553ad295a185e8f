China on Monday called on the international community to jointly safeguard the outcomes of the victory of World War II and uphold the international system with the United Nations at its core. Responding to a question about Russia's Victory Day military parade, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War was achieved through joint efforts by all peace-loving countries and people across the globe. The victory laid an important foundation for the establishment of the postwar international order, he said at a regular press briefing. The international community should jointly safeguard the outcomes of the victory of WWII, firmly uphold the international system with the UN at its core and the international order underpinned by international law, practice true multilateralism, and maintain world peace and tranquility, Zhao said. An important lesson that the world can learn from the victory is that countries should be committed to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and seeking common ground while reserving differences, he said. They should uphold a vision of common, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable security, and respect and address the legitimate security concerns of each country, he said. Confrontation, division and conflict should be replaced by dialogue, solidarity and cooperation, he added, calling it the only way to maintain world peace and promote common development. Russia held its annual Victory Day military parade at Moscow's Red Square on Monday to mark the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Union's defeat of Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War. (Cover: File photo of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. /CFP)
