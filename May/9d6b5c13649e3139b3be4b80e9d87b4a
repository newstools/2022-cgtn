China has started a new comprehensive scientific expedition on Mount Qomolangma, the world's highest peak on the China-Nepal border. The weather from October to March and April in Mount Qomolangma is really windy. Its rainy season lasts from June to September. So by contrast, the most stable and suitable month for climbing is May. To safeguard the scientific expedition, a meteorological support team has been launched. The mountain is also known as 'the Third Pole of the Earth.' The top part of the mountain is covered with snow all year around. You can also find bright glaciers and miles of efflorescent rock physiognomy there. It is important in studying the impact of global warming due to its sensitivity to rising temperatures. The Mount Qomolangma Nature Reserve is also home to many precious species including snow leopard and wild ass. Let's take a look at some amazing photos of the mountain.
