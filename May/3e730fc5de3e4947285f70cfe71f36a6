Since the resumption of diplomatic relations six months ago, China and Nicaragua have made a good start in bilateral cooperation with high speed and high standards, which fully shows that the resumption of diplomatic ties conforms to the trend of history and the trend of the times and serves the fundamental interests of the two countries and peoples, State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said during a phone call with his Nicaraguan counterpart Denis Moncada on Friday. Regarding Nicaragua as a trustworthy and important partner, China firmly supports Nicaragua's sovereignty, independence and national dignity and respects Nicaragua's independent choice of development path. China appreciates Nicaragua's adherence to the one-China principle, its opposition to any form of "Taiwan independence" and firm support for China's position on issues concerning China's core interests, Wang said. Noting that China is ready to strengthen the synergy of development strategies with Nicaragua under the framework of jointly building the Belt and Road cooperation, Wang said that China will firmly support Nicaragua's economic and social development and will continue to provide assistance to Nicaragua in its fight against COVID-19. China is ready to strengthen communication and cooperation with Nicaragua in international affairs, jointly hold the banner of multilateralism, promote international solidarity and cooperation, implement Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative, and promote the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, Wang added. Expressing that Nicaragua will unswervingly adhere to the one-China principle, Moncada said that the relations between the two countries have achieved high-level and rapid development since the resumption of the bilateral ties. Nicaragua highly appreciates China's assistance in its fight against the pandemic, as well as in its economic and social development, said Moncada, adding that his country advocates a series of international initiatives put forward by China, and is willing to take part in the Global Development Initiative and Global Security Initiative.
