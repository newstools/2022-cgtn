With 131 days left until this year's Hangzhou Asian Games, six Chinese national teams have been training for the event at the Olympic Sports Center in Beijing. China's men's and women's rugby, men's and women's field hockey, men's water polo, and women's softball teams are now holding practice sessions in the capital. Rugby, water polo, and field hockey recently moved to the National Olympic Sports Center from their previous bases. After conducting physical training activities in the winter and early spring, the squads said they've made a lot of progress. They are now scheduled to continue training, while also looking to gain more experience in international competitions. To help the athletes improve their form, and assist them in preparing for the Games, staff at the venue have organized several additional activities, including competitions aimed at testing their all-around skills.
