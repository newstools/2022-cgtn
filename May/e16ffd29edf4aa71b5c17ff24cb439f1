Carlos Alcaraz's meteoric rise continued on Friday when the Spanish prodigy outplayed American Sebastian Korda in straight sets to reach the last 16 of French Open for the first time. Alcaraz took revenge for last month's loss to Korda in Monte Carlo, his only clay-court defeat this year. The sixth-seed started strong and closed out the opener 6 to 4.
