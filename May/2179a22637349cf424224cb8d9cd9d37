Robert Lewandowski says his "story with Bayern Munich is over," confirming speculation that the Polish forward intends to leave the German Bundesliga champions this summer. Speaking ahead of Poland's UEFA Nations League opener against Wales, the 33-year-old said, "For today, it is certain that my story with Bayern Munich is over and I cannot imagine further cooperation with the club after what happened in recent months." Despite being under contract through the summer of 2023, Lewandowski believes the German club will allow him to leave, with Spanish La Liga giants Barcelona heavily favored to sign the prolific striker. Lewandowski joined Bayern from Borussia Dortmund in 2014, and has been extremely productive since making the move to Munich, scoring 344 goals in 374 outings. As many as 110 of those goals came in the last three Bundesliga seasons, including 41 in 2020-21 to break Gerd Mueller's long-standing record of 40 goals in a single campaign, which had been on the books since the 1971-72 campaign. Lewandowski's honors with the Bavarians include eight consecutive Bundesliga trophies, a UEFA Champions League title, three DFB-Pokals, and a FIFA Club World Cup. He was also named Best FIFA Men's Player in 2020 and 2021, and claimed the European Golden Shoe as the continent's top scorer for his efforts in both the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons.
