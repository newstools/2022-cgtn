The solar term Lixia, or the start of summer, begins on May 5 this year. From this solar term, the summer breath becomes stronger, following by high temperatures and a hot sun. In Qingxiushan Park of Nanning City in southern China's Guangxi Autonomous Region, the water lilies that are famous for their heat-lover characteristic are blooming as if they are welcoming the solar term.
