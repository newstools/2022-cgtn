German Sebastian Steudtner has set a new Guinness World Record for the largest wave surfed by a male surfer. As part of the Red Bull Big Wave Awards, the World Surf League has officially analyzed, measured, and verified Staedtler's 2021 Big Wave Award-winning ride at 86 feet (26.21 meters), setting the new mark for the unlimited category for the men's largest wave surfed. The 37-year-old from the city of Nuremberg successfully surfed the wave from trough to crest at the infamous big-wave break known as Praia do Norte in Nazare, Portugal, on October 29, 2020. The ride won the Biggest Tow Award at the 2021 Red Bull Big Wave Awards, making it eligible for World Record verification. Steudtner, who moved to Hawaii aged 16 to pursue a career in professional surfing, has made a name for himself in the big-wave surfing world with numerous wins and awards. (With input from AP)
