Luis Enrique, head coach of Spain's national football team, Monday announced his 25-man squad for the team's four Nations League fixtures next month. Teenager Ansu Fati has returned to the side following a long injury lay-off – the Barca forward last represented his country in October 2020. Real Madrid forward Marco Asensio is also back on the squad that includes Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcantara and Barcelona midfielders Gavi Paez and Sergio Busquets. "We have talked to the player and it doesn't seem to be too serious," Enrique commented on Thiago being on the list after leaving his last game injured and not knowing if he could play the Champions League final. "We are aware that the next thing ahead of him is the final, and we've called him because he has played a great season. He's one of the players who has not come back since the Euros. I think this is good for him and we will be watching if he can make it to the final. If he does, that will be great. If he doesn't, he will join us and our doctors will evaluate him."
