Dechen Ngodrup has made his fifth ascent to the summit of Mt. Qomolangma, also known as Mt. Everest to Westerners. He and his team successfully set up the world's highest weather station there. Data will be transmitted down to the base camp for scientists to carry out research. As a professional mountaineer, Dechen Ngodrup now dreams of more than the summit. He wants to pursue science.
