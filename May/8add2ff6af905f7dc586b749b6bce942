UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Saturday he's alarmed after the Taliban ordered Afghan women to cover their faces in public and leave home only in cases of necessity. "I once again urge the Taliban to keep their promises to Afghan women & girls, and their obligations under international human rights law," Guterres said on Twitter.
