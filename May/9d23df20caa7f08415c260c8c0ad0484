Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola enjoyed a lighthearted joke at Manchester United fans' expense ahead of the Premier League climax on Sunday. Supporters of the Old Trafford club would generally prefer Manchester City to win the league and deny Liverpool the opportunity for a historic quadruple haul of trophies, eclipsing United's treble-winning side of 1999. "So, United likes City more than Liverpool? Oh my gosh, I didn't know that. Is it true? So, I was wrong when I said that everyone wants Liverpool to win in this country? I was wrong! Yeah, they're welcome if they want to join us, but they have to wear a blue shirt; they have to wear it," joked Guardiola. (With input from AP)
