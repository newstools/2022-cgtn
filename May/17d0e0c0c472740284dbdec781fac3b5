The bodies of four miners have been found in a zinc mine in Burkina Faso after 39 days of search, BBC reported on Wednesday, citing a government spokesperson. Eight miners got trapped hundreds of meters underground by flood waters last month in the Canadian-owned mine in Perkoa. Search operations are continuing to find the other four missing miners.
