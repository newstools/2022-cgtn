UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss announced on Tuesday her intention to bring forward legislation which will pave way to change parts of the UK's post-Brexit trade deal on Northern Ireland. The deal ensures that Northern Ireland can remain in the EU's single market and has introduced some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney on Tuesday warned that "breaking international law" is not the answer to solving Protocol issues, calling for negotiation.
