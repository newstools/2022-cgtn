Biniam Girmay claimed stage 10 of the Giro d'Italia on Tuesday to create history as the first Black African to win on any of the three grand tours but his celebrations were cut short by a champagne cork. Girmay was struck in his face when fumbling with a magnum bottle on the winners' podium, leaving him rubbing and holding his left eye. The cyclist appeared deeply agitated as he was led into an ambulance and taken to hospital. He had placed the bottle on the floor and bent over it as he undid the binding before the cork flew off, hitting him from close range. Girmay's team said a decision would be made Wednesday morning on whether or not he would continue in the race. The 22-year-old Eritrean had proven too strong for Dutch ace Mathieu van der Poel, who threw up his hands in resignation after a long struggle for the line at Jesi. Van der Poel hugged Girmay at the line after giving him a sporting thumbs up while he watched his rival race to victory. He now stands second in the sprint points race, just three points behind Frenchman Arnaud Demare on 151, with Van der Poel third another 58 points behind. While multiple tour winner Chris Froome was born in Kenya and Daryl Impey of South Africa has won stages, Girmay is the first Black African to do so. "I watched the Giro as a kid on television and then went out riding with the dream of one day taking part," Girmay said, before his podium accident. "We write a little piece of history every day," he added. "I'm really happy about what I did today, I don't have the words to describe it. Thanks to my team who controlled the race from early on."
