China's first large emergency response and rescue vessel completed its maiden sea trial on Tuesday in waters off the coast of Jiujiang City, east China's Jiangxi Province. The engineering vessel, named "China Emergency Jiujiang," is an integrated emergency rescue platform with an advanced information system. The vessel can reach a top speed of 28 km/h (15 knots), and can sail for 1,000 kilometres without stopping. The ship has supplies onboard to last up to 10 days without resupply. After being officially commissioned, the ship will undertake tasks such as flood rescue, embankment reinforcement, levee maintenance and breach sealing. It will also improve the emergency rescue capability in the Yangtze River Basin and provide a strong safety guarantee for shipping in the region's vital sea lanes.
