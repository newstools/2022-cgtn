Algerian football club ES Setif will be hoping to cause another upset in the African Champions League when they face Egyptian side Al Ahly in the semi-finals. Their coach Darko Novic said ahead of Saturday's game, " We know that it was a big surprise for many of you. Big surprise in Africa. We don't think about a new surprise. Just to think about the next match here in Cairo and to apply our strategy and how we can resist them and play a very good game against Al Ahly." The Algerian team surprised four-time winners ES Tunis in the quarter-finals and will face a difficult test against Al Ahly who are the most successful team in the competition having lifted the title 10 times. The first leg takes place in the Egyptian capital on Saturday with the reverse fixture the following week in Algiers.
