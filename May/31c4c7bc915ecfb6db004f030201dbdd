China's Qieyang Shijie won the women's 10km race walk at the World Athletics Race Walking Tour Gold event in Madrid, Spain on Monday. Clocking 43 minutes and seven seconds, Qieyang clinched her second title of the season after winning women's 35km race walk in 2:43:06 in Dudince, Slovakia last month. Qieyang was in the leading group with Kimberly Garcia from Peru and Laura Garcia-Caro from Spain since the beginning of the race, and broke away from her two rivals after they passed the 5km benchmark in 21 minutes and 43 seconds, leading them by 30 and 43 seconds, respectively, at the finish line. Qieyang has enjoyed a fruitful season so far, as she is expected to be awarded a gold medal of the women's 20km race walk from the 2012 London Summer Olympics in which Qieyang originally took silver, following the disqualification of Elena Lashmanova's 1st place finish due to the use of prohibited substances. China's Ji Haiying and Li Maocuo finished 4th and 7th behind compatriot Qieyang. In the men's event, Sweden's Perseus Karlstrom clinched the title in 38 minutes and 42 seconds to outclass Spain's Diego Garcia. (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
