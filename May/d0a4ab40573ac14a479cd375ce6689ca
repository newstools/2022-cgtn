Russia's Foreign Ministry on Wednesday announced sanctions against 63 Japanese officials, journalists and professors for engaging in what it called an "unprecedented anti-Russian campaign with unacceptable rhetoric" against Moscow. The list includes Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, Foreign Minister Yoshimasa Hayashi, Defense Minister Nobuo Kishi and Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno. The sanctions bar the targeted individuals from entering Russia indefinitely, the ministry said. Japan has joined the United States and European countries in imposing various sanctions on Russia since Moscow launched what it describes as a "special military operation" in Ukraine on February 24. Japan's Cabinet approved additional sanctions against Russia last month, freezing the assets of 398 Russian individuals, including President Vladimir Putin's two daughters and the wife of Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, and banning imports of vodka and other goods.  Japan also decided to freeze the assets of 28 more Russian organizations, such as those related to military business, and two more lenders, Sberbank and Alfa Bank.
