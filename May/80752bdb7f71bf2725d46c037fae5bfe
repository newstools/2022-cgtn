China's mid-sized multi-purpose helicopter AC352 has completed functionality and reliability tests, its developer, the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), announced on Saturday. The AC352 helicopter landed at an airport in northeast China's Harbin City at 10:22 a.m. on May 28 after completing a long-distance ferry flight test. All parts and equipment worked well during the test flight, said AVIC, China's leading aircraft maker. The test flight is the final one before the helicopter enters the final phase of assessment and approval for obtaining the airworthiness certification required by civil aviation authorities. The AC352 is a twin-engine multi-purpose civil helicopter jointly developed by AVIC and Airbus Helicopters. It can carry up to 16 passengers with a maximum take-off weight of 7.5 tonnes. The new helicopter-model enriches the pedigree of China's civil helicopter family in the 7-tonne class, and is of great importance for the country in enhancing the capabilities of its helicopter industry sector, the AVIC said. The AC352 successfully completed its maiden flight on December 20, 2016. It then began its flight-test journey for airworthiness certification at the end of 2019. The performance of the AC352 was fully verified during previous flight tests in high temperatures, low temperatures, sub-plateau environments and other complicated environments across the country, the AVIC said.
