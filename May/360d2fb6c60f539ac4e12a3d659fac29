A senior Ukrainian official says the country should not sign any peace agreements with Russia. RBC news agency reported that Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council Oleksii Danilov said an exception can only be made for a peace deal if Russia surrenders. Danilov also stressed that the conflict will not end soon, as a turning point has not yet come. But he said considering the number of weapons being delivered to Ukraine by the West, a turning point is bound to happen. Russia has not responded to the comments.
