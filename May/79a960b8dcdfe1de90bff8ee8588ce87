China's passenger car sales plummeted by more than a third in April while new energy vehicle (NEV) sales surged despite COVID-19 resurgences, data from an industry association showed Tuesday.Car retail sales in April plunged by 35.5 percent, the biggest monthly drop in more than two years, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). Outbreaks of COVID-19 in April have had negative impacts on car production and sales, the CPCA said. It said the production of five major carmakers in Shanghai decreased by 75 percent from March, citing restrictive measures in the city, suspension of factories and severe impacts on logistics.Retail sales of NEVs, in comparison, rose 78.4 percent year on year in April, as buyers anticipated that manufacturers might raise prices, according to the CPCA. China's automakers are trying to resume production gradually, the association said, noting that the supply chain has been recovering since the start of May.
