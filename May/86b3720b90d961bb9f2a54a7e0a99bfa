Mycena lux-coeli mushrooms, also known as "heavenly light mushrooms," emit an eerie greenish light in the woods of the Wakayama Prefecture town of Nachikatsuura, western Japan on the night of May 14, 2022. A bioluminescent species of fungus in the family Mycenaceae, Mycena lux-coeli has a short lifespan of a few days, as they are subject to dehydration. They grow on fallen Chinquapin trees during the rainy season in Japan. (All images via CFP) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
