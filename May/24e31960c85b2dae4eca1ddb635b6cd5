Nicolo Zaniolo's goal earned AS Roma a first major European title in more than 60 years after a 1-0 win over Feyenoord in the Europa Conference League final in Albania on Wednesday, completing a unique European trophy haul for Jose Mourinho.  Roma head coach Mourinho, who had previously won the Champions League, Europa League and the UEFA Cup with other clubs, can now add the third-tier European title – the Italian side's first trophy in 14 years – to his medal tally. Zaniolo, 22, earned Roma victory with an expertly-taken finish in the 32nd minute as he became the first Italian to score in a European final since Filippo Inzaghi in the 2007 Champions League. Roma, whose only previous continental title was the old Fairs Cup in 1961, held off a spirited comeback from their Dutch opponents, who were twice denied by the woodwork in the second half. The victory ensured that Mourinho became the first manager to win a European trophy with four different clubs, after previous successes at Porto, Inter Milan and Manchester United. (With input from Reuters)
