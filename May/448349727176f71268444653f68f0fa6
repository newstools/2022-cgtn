Finland and Sweden are expected to submit their bids to join the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on May 18. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov says the two countries joining NATO would probably not make much difference as both Sweden and Finland had long participated in the alliance's military drills. Russia has also expelled two diplomats from the Finnish Embassy in retaliation to the expulsion for two Russian diplomats from Finland.
