UN prosecutors confirmed on Wednesday that one of the last fugitives wanted in connection with the 1994 Rwanda genocide, Pheneas Munyarugarama, died in the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2002. Munyarugarama, a Rwandan army commander, "died from natural causes on or about 28 February 2002 in Kankwala, in the eastern provinces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where he was also buried," the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals (MICT) said in a statement. The news comes less than a week after the tribunal announced the death of Protais Mpiranya, the top wanted suspect in the deaths of some 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in a 100-day slaughter in April-July 1994. "For the victims and survivors of Munyarugarama's crimes in the Bugesera region, we hope this result brings some closure," MICT Chief Prosecutor Serge Brammertz said in the statement. A former lieutenant-colonel in the Rwandan Armed Forces (FAR), Munyarugarama was charged by the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) with eight counts including genocide and crimes against humanity. "Munyarugarama was alleged to be responsible for mass killings, attacks, and sexual violence against Tutsi civilians at various locations in the Bugesera region," the MICT said, adding it had conducted a "comprehensive and challenging investigation" to find him. Prosecutors last week announced the death from tuberculosis of leading fugitive Mpiranya in Zimbabwe in 2006. Only four fugitives are still being sought by the tribunal: Fulgence Kayishema, Charles Sikubwabo, Charles Ryandikayo and Aloys Ndimbati. Brammertz said his office "is now fully focused" on tracking them down. Top fugitive and alleged genocide financier Felicien Kabuga was arrested near Paris in 2020.
