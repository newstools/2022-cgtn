The first freight train to benefit from China's latest fast tax refund policy arrived at south China's Beibu Bay on Wednesday. The cloth and fertilizers loaded on the X9607 train will be set sail to Indonesia in containers from the port. The pilot policy allows qualified land-sea freight trains, launched from a land port in Xi'an City and leaving the country through the Beibu Bay, to apply for tax refunds at their freight starting point. The average time for enterprise tax refunds has been reduced from a month to two-three days, speeding up capital turnover for small and medium-sized enterprises.
