European Union foreign ministers have failed to agree on the 6th package of sanctions against Russia. Hungary opposes an oil embargo, a measure proposed by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell says Hungary's position was based on economic concerns and not political reasons. But Borrell says the bloc will provide another 500 million euros of weapon purchases to Ukraine.
