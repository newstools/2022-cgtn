Italian legend rider Valentino Rossi's iconic number 46 has been retired from use in Moto Grand Prix (GP), at a ceremony held prior to the qualifying at the Italian race at Mugello Circuit on Saturday. "Valentino Rossi changed Grand Prix motorcycle racing forever. Over 26 seasons of history-making competition, the Italian captured hearted around the world and broke myriad records, taking the sport to new heights with his mixture of charisma, creativity, and incredible talent," read the words engraved on a trophy of the number 46. "Named a MotoGP legend upon retiring at the end of 2021, the Italian's nine World Championships, 115 wins, and 235 podiums across all classes tell their own story – but the tale behind the numbers is one of redefining a sport, on-track and off," the words continued. Rossi said he had "a mixture of feelings" about his retirement. "From one side, it is very sad that I've finished, I've stopped, and also the 46 it is retired from MotoGP. On the other side, it is a great feeling because it was a long story and an unforgettable career full of great moments, so I am very proud of this. Today it was good, here in Mugello, because it is always a special place, it is always the home of the Italian GP, our home GP, and it is also good because I have always raced with the 46 from the first year. 46 for me means a lot, because it was the number of Graziano, of my father, when he finished second in the 250cc Championship. I am very happy because it is a sign, it is not just a number." Also, Rossi is the winner of the 2006 Laureus Spirit of Sport, 2011 Laureus World Comeback of the Year and the 2022 Laureus Sporting Icon Award. He was inducted into the MotoGP's Hall of Fame in November, 2021. "It was a long career, and always a pleasure," said Rossi during the induction ceremony.
