Australia's Labor government, led by new Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, has secured a majority in the parliament with 76 lower house seats, allowing it to form a government without the support of independents or minor parties, official election data showed Tuesday. Local media said the final tally might rise to 77 as counting continues on two close seats. Albanese called a party meeting on Tuesday to discuss the makeup of the full cabinet and is expected to make the appointments public within the next day, the media reported. Anthony Albanese claimed victory for his Labor Party after then-Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded defeat in Australia's federal election on May 21. (With input from Reuters)
