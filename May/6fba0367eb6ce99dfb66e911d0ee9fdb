A local organization called "Say no to NATO" launched a demonstration against Sweden's potential NATO membership in Stockholm on Saturday. The protest came a day before Sweden's ruling Social Democrats decides whether to apply to join NATO. Protesters said the Swedish government's main task should be protecting the country's independence and peace. Joining NATO would run counter to that task and intensify the current situation, they said.
