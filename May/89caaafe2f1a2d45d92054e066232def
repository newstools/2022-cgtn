Taken by photographer Lin Ge, photographs show some beautiful gadwalls flying in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. The migratory birds like to live in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, river bays, ponds and marshes, especially in open waters rich in aquatic plants. They can be occasionally seen in coastal marshes as well.
