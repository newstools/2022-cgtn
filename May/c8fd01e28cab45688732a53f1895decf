Tesla's CEO Elon Musk has endorsed China's technological edge in renewable energy and electric vehicles in May 30 posts on Twitter and Weibo, saying China is "leading the world." However, He Xiaopeng, CEO of one of China's top electric vehicle companies, responded that China still needs 10 years of effort before it can truly lead the world in these areas. Musk's comment comes as Tesla's massive Shanghai "giga-factory" pushes its workers to the limit to meet production targets amid an ongoing pandemic lockdown.
