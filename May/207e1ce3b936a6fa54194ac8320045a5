Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp addressed the media on Wednesday and played down suggestions that Liverpool are seeking revenge over Real Madrid in Saturday's Champions League final. The two sides met in the 2018 final with Madrid winning 3-1. On that night in Kyiv, Liverpool's Mo Salah was forced off early through injury following a robust challenge from then Madrid captain Sergio Ramos. "I don't believe in revenge. I don't think that revenge is a fantastic idea," said Klopp. "I understand it but I'm not sure it's the right thing to do. I understand what Mo (Salah) said, that he wanted to put it right, I want to put it right. In Germany we say you always meet twice in life. That sounds like more of a threat than it actually is. It's just like behave better in the first moment because if you meet again you will get the reaction." "It's all fine between me and us and Real Madrid. It will be football at the highest level and whoever thinks it's a good idea to give us the opportunity to win it this time, I think it will be a great story but it will not happen because of what happened in 2018. It will happen because we make the right decisions on the pitch and I hope we can do that." klopp added. The Liverpool manager also said winning the Champions League again would cap a fantastic season for his side and that midfielder Thiago Alcantara could feature despite picking up an injury against Wolves last weekend. （With input from AP）
