The payloads include a landing camera, a panoramic camera, a lunar mineralogical spectrometer and a lunar regolith penetrating radar, according to the CNSA. To facilitate scientific research among the public, the CNSA announced public users can visit the website of China's Lunar and Planetary Data Release System to obtain the datasets. The Chang'e-5 probe, comprising an orbiter, a lander, an ascender and a returner, was launched on November 24, 2020.
