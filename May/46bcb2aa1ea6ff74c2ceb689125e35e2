An exhibition featuring a collection of space-themed paintings created by Chinese youth was held at the China Science and Technology Museum in Beijing to mark the first anniversary of the launch of the Tianhe core module of the country's space station. The largest spacecraft independently developed by China, the Tianhe was launched on April 29, 2021. With a total length of 16.6 meters and a takeoff mass of 22.5 tonnes, it supports astronauts carrying out scientific and technical experiments in space. In the past year, the core module has successfully received spacecraft, including cargo crafts Tianzhou-2 and Tianzhou-3 and manned spaceships Shenzhou-12 and Shenzhou-13. Six Chinese astronauts were on board the crewed spacecraft and stayed in orbit for months. Take a look at some of the works on display.
