Second-seeded Alexander Zverev of Germany got revenge for his Monte Carlo semi-final loss last month to Greek Stefanos Tsitsipas, with a 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 win on Saturday in the second semi-final of the Madrid Open. In the pair's 11th matchup, Zverev capitalized on the only break in the 7th game of the first set to claim it 6-4. Tsitsipas broke late to win three games in a row and take the second set 6-3. However, two-time Madrid champion Zverev quickly turned the tide by sweeping the opening three games of the decider, before closing out the contest 6-2 after one hour and 53 minutes. The 25-year-old German now moves to his 10th ATP Masters 1000 final. He is seeking his sixth title at that level, with his five current crowns the most of any active player outside Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andy Murray. The world No.3 also improved his ATP head to head series to 4-7 against Tsitsipas, earning his first clay-court win in four tries against the world No.5. "I thought from yesterday onwards I started to play really well," said Zverev. "I'm just extremely happy to be in the final here. I know it's going to be an extremely tough match tomorrow but I hope I can manage to play my best and give myself a chance." The German will now aim to complete his Madrid title defence against Spanish teen and home favorite Carlos Alcaraz, who overcame world No.1 Djokovic 6-7(5), 7-5, 7-6(5) in Saturday's other semi-final. The 19-year-old world No.9 goes into Sunday's final as the first player ever to beat Nadal and Djokovic at the same clay court event. Tsitsipas meanwhile leaves the Spanish capital with a 27-8 tour-level record on the season, now tied with Alcaraz for the joint-most wins in 2022.
