Poland has restored gas supplies to around a dozen municipalities, after a halt of supplies caused by sanctions on Novatek Green Energy, a Russian gas company operating in the country. Poland's state gas giant, PGNiG, says the Russian firm has complied with the demand to make its pipelines available to Polish companies that are now starting to convey their gas to the affected areas.
