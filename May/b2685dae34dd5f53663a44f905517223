At least seven people died and scores plucked to safety in the Philippines on Monday after a fire ripped through a ferry and forced passengers to jump overboard, the coast guard and witnesses said. The ferry was carrying 134 passengers and crew from Polillo Island to Real in Quezon Province on the main island of Luzon. Seven people died and 120 have been rescued so far, Philippine Coast Guard spokesperson Commodore Armando Balilo said. Another seven were missing and a search operation was underway.
