Chinese archaeologists have restored an ancient cultural relic once cherished by high nobility during the Han Dynasty some 2,000 years ago. Originally dubbed the "Confucius Portrait Screen," the artifact, unearthed in east China's Jiangxi in 2015, was first thought to be a lacquer screen, and was once set in the living room of Marquis of Haihun. After nearly seven years of repairing and splicing, archaeologists revealed that it is not just a screen partition but a "mirror screen" integrating the functions of screen and dressing mirror. The world's earliest portrait of Confucius has been painted on the back of the screen. Check out these photos below to figure out the true features of this historic artifact.
