Paris Saint-Germain forward Lionel Messi says there is "no doubt" Real Madrid striker Karim Benzema deserves to win his first Ballon d'Or award this year. The 34-year-old Messi is training with Argentina in Bilbao, Spain for the "Finalissima," a revival of the CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions previously played in the 1980s and '90s between the Copa America winners and European titleholders. The Trans-Atlantic competition will mark its return when the Argentines meet Italy on Wednesday. Messi has earned a record seven Ballon d'Or awards as the world's best player, but saw his new club PSG eliminated by Real at the last 16 stage of this season's UEFA Champions League, with Benzema scoring a hat-trick in the second half of the return leg. Benzema netted four more goals against Chelsea in the quarterfinals and three against Manchester City in the semifinals, including a decisive penalty kick in extra time to seal the second leg, before Los Blancos defeated Liverpool 1-0 in the final on Saturday. The 34-year-old French veteran was also the top scorer in the Spanish La Liga to help Real Madrid claim the league title in dominant fashion. In total, Benzema scored 44 goals in 46 matches with his team this season, and tied Raul Gonzalez for second place on Real's all-time scoring chart with 323. The duo sit 128 goals behind Cristiano Ronaldo's club record of 451. But even though Real Madrid knocked out a quartet of European giants en route to the Champions League title, Messi says he wasn't overly impressed with the team's style of play. Los Blancos needed big comebacks to put away both PSG and Man City and had Benzema to thank both times. (With input from AP)
