Have you ever thought about what the world would be like if animals and plants all disappeared? No lions galloping on grassland. No birds flying freely in the sky. No dolphins jumping out of water. No living creatures. The world would lose its infinite palette. Let us, therefore, grab the chance to cherish all life and make the world ever more colorful. CGTN Nature will host a series of livestreams on May 22, the International Day for Biological Diversity. We'll travel to the world's seven continents and explore our colorful planet, learn about the animals that live around us and discover the species that have left us as well as those most at risk. Stay tuned! (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
