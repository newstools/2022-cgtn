China's Zheng Qinwen gave world No.1 Iga Swiatek of Poland a scare as the top seed advanced to the quarterfinals with a 6-7(5), 6-0, 6-2 victory at the French Open on Monday. Ranked 74th in the world, 19-year-old Zheng made an impression as a potential successor of Chinese tennis star Li Na when she defeated Simona Halep and Alize Cornet in what was only her second Grand Slam tour. Though Zheng fell short of advancing to the last eight in Paris, she managed to end Swiatek's unbeaten run in the opening set that lasted 82 minutes. The 2020 French Open champion wasted three set points at 5-3 and two more at 6-5 with Zheng forcing a tiebreak after throwing the kitchen sink at her. Swiatek moved 5-2 up in the break, but Zheng won the remaining five points to take the set. Nicknamed "Fire," the teenage sensation couldn't keep her momentum in the following sets, as she explained later that she suffered from menstrual cramps. Earlier in February this year, Zheng spoke to International Tennis Federation (ITF) about her career goal after her Grand Slam debut at the Australian Open. "I hope to win at least one Grand Slam title in five years. People say I'm strong on clay court. And I like the French Open. If I can win one, I'd like my first title to be the French Open." Zheng has now become the fourth Chinese player to enter the women's singles last 16 at the French Open, following Zheng Jie, Li Na and Zhang Shuai. Following the footsteps of Li, with whom Zheng shares similar backgrounds in terms of the coaches they've worked with, and the fact that both come from central China's Hubei Province, Zheng looks even fitter with a height of 5 feet and 11 inches and the ability to fire an ace serve of 170km/h at the age of 17. "I have always believed I could do it, and that I'm good enough to beat world No.1. Today was unfortunate. I hope I can play my style the next time we meet," Zheng said after the match.
