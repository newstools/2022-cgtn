China has called for the U.S. to respond positively to Iran's "reasonable" concerns on nuclear issues, and promote a smooth conclusion to negotiations as nuclear talks enter their final stage, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a regular conference on Thursday. The U.S. Special Envoy for Iran, Rob Malley, said Wednesday that the prospects of a return to the Iran nuclear deal are "tenuous at best," according to CNN. China urged the U.S. to work towards political solutions, since it was the instigator of the nuclear crisis in Iran, Wang said. China will continue to participate in negotiations to get the Iran nuclear agreement, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), back on track, and safeguard the system of international nuclear non-proliferation which helps maintain peace and stability in the Middle East.
