Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's chief of staff resigned on Monday, less than two weeks after another senior aide bolted in a double blow to a leader who has yet to complete his first year in power. A statement from the prime minister's office gave no reason for Tal Gan Zvi's departure after a decade at Bennett's side. Shimrit Meir, the premier's senior adviser, resigned on May 13 citing "considerable sacrifices in (her) personal life." Israeli media have reported feuding among Bennett's inner circle as his political fortunes appear increasingly tenuous. Bennett cobbled together a cross-partisan coalition to end Benjamin Netanyahu's record 12-year run as prime minister last year. Two lawmakers recently resigned from the governing coalition, which has since become a minority in parliament. The second resignation, which happened last week, came against the backdrop of growing tensions between the Israeli government and the Palestinians. Ghaida Rinawie Zoabi, a member of the left-wing Meretz party, said her decision to quit was prompted by violence against worshipers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and during the funeral procession of slain Palestinian journalist Shireen Abu Akleh, who is suspected to have been killed by the Israeli army.
