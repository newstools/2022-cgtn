Jesse Marsch and his Leeds United side escaped relegation on the final day of the English Premier League season with a 2-1 victory at Brentford on Sunday. Leeds took the lead with a Raphinha penalty in the 56th minute, only to see Sergi Canos equalize two minutes later. Canos was sent off with nine minutes left and Leeds finished with a flourish as Jack Harrison found the net deep into stoppage time at the end of the game. Marsch always believed that Leeds would stay up, "I believed that we were going to do this. There wasn't one day I didn't believe. And that's why I never talked about being in the Championship. For me, this business is about belief and about exuding it as a leader." A win would not have been enough for Leeds had Burnley won at home against Newcastle, but they lost 2-1 and finished 18th. Burnley finished on 35 points from their 38 games, with Leeds on 38 – had Burnley managed to win, they would have stayed up as they had a superior goal difference, but ultimately, they will join Watford and Norwich in the Championship next season.
