Travelers entering China via Beijing will be subject to 10 days of concentrated isolation, down from 14 days, plus seven days of home quarantine, the Beijing municipal government announced on Wednesday. The government said the adjustment was made according to the characteristics of a short incubation period and mild clinical symptoms of the Omicron variant of COVID 19. Meanwhile, people entering China through other cities who have completed 14 days of quarantine can travel to Beijing if they meet related requirements that match those of other residents.
