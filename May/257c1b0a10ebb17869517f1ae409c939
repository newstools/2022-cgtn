U.S. troops did not bring peace, but only trouble to Afghanistan, Sayed Javad Hosseini, leader of the Justice and Development Party of Afghanistan said on Saturday, as the country suffered consecutive blasts just before the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. Hosseini said the attacks were the result of last year's irresponsible withdrawal of U.S. troops, who had promised to restore peace for the Afghan people.
