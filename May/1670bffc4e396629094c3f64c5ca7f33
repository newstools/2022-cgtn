If you want to see wildlife roaming on an open plain, Africa should definitely be at the top of your list. The Amboseli National Park in Kenya is known as the land of elephants. Visitors can get a close look at these free-ranging giants in the park and encounter numerous wildlife depicted in the famous movie "The Lion King," including lions, hyenas, giraffes and zebras. CGTN's Peninah Karibe takes you on a ride to learn about elephants, lions and many other animals living in the park. Peek into their secret lives and enjoy the beautiful scenery under Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest peak.
