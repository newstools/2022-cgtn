The Ukrainian capital celebrated the 1,540th anniversary of its official founding on Sunday. The Kyiv Day celebrations took on a special meaning this year, given that the city was surrounded by Russian forces just months ago. Enjoying the sunshine, residents took to public parks and squares where special events were held.
