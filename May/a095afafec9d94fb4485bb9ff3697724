Incessant rainfall followed by flash floods has wreaked havoc in India's northeastern state of Assam, inundating low-lying areas and washing away roads, officials said Sunday. The floods hit six districts, killing at least three people and affecting around 25,000 more in the affected areas. Floods are an annual occurrence in Assam during the monsoon season.
