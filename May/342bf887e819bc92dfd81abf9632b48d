U.S. President Joe Biden took steps on Wednesday to address the domestic shortage of infant formula, invoking the Defense Production Act to help manufacturers obtain the ingredients needed to ramp up supply, the White House said. Biden also directed U.S. agencies to use Defense Department commercial aircraft to bring formula into the U.S. Baby formula aisles at U.S. supermarkets have been decimated since top U.S. manufacturer Abbott Laboratories recalled formulas in February after complaints of bacterial infections.
