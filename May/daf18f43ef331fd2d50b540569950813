The army of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has been engaged in heavy fighting recently with the M23 rebel group. The group is fighting its most sustained offensive since a 2012-2013 insurrection that captured vast swathes of territory. The fighting has forced tens of thousands to flee their homes in a region that has had little respite from conflict.
