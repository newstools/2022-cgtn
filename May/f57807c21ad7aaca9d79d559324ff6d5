Israeli forces on Saturday arrested two people suspected of killing an Israeli security guard the night before, the military said in a statement. They were tracked down in a Palestinian village seven kilometers from the scene of the attack, the statement added. Late Friday, gunmen shot and killed an Israeli security guard at the entrance of the Ariel settlement in the occupied West Bank and fled the scene quickly, according to CCTV footage. Tensions have been running high between Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank in recent weeks that overlap with the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and have seen 15 Israelis killed in a spate of attacks. On Thursday, the Israeli military said six reserve battalions will be called up to strengthen defensive efforts against "terrorist attacks."
