In Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China's Sichuan Province, Temminck's tragopans live in the dense forest all year around. Apart from the mating season in the spring, the pheasants forage in groups. When they go out and come back home in the morning and at night, they usually make chirping sounds to each other, similar to the sound of a baby crying. That's why they are also called baby chick or wawaji (娃娃鸡) in Chinese. Similar to many other pheasants, male Temminck's tragopans are more flamboyant than the females. They are overall red-orange with white-spotted plumage, and have a blue facial skin. The males also have a pair of blue "horns" on top their heads, which typically sit flat but stick up during the courtship. In comparison, the dull color of the females acts as camouflage for them during the incubation.
