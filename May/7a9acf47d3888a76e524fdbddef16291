U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden grieved with the shattered community of Uvalde, Texas, on Sunday, as they attended a memorial for 19 students and two teachers who were killed during a mass shooting at a Texas elementary school. Faced with chants of "do something" during the visit, Biden responded: "We will." As more details were released to the public, questions and criticisms around how the police handled the tragedy have mounted in recent days.
