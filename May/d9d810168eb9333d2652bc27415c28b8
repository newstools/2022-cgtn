As summer is around the corner, clouds of blue jacaranda are in full bloom in Kunming City in southwest China's Yunnan Province. The "purple clouds" enveloping the streets make the city look like a peaceful dreamland. Native to South America, blue jacaranda is widely planted around the world for its beautiful violet flowers. The trees can grow up to 20 meters high, casting shades for pedestrians during hot summer days. (All images via CFP.)
