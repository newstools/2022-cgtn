Liverpool saw their hopes of winning the Premier League title this season stalled as they were held to a 1-1 draw on Saturday by Tottenham Hotspur. Son Heung-Min gave Spurs the lead in the 56th minute when he converted Ryan Sessegnon's cross from close range. Luis Diaz later leveled when his shot took an unexpected deflection to beat Hugo Lloris, preserving Liverpool's long unbeaten run at home in the League. But the Reds' main rivals for the title, Manchester City, have one more game in hand and face Newcastle on Sunday, where they have a strong chance of taking three points to overtake Liverpool in the standings. Both teams currently stand at 83 points, with Liverpool outranking Man City on goal difference. Besides chasing the League title, Liverpool also have the UEFA Champions League final to prepare for, where they will face Real Madrid. Also on Saturday, Manchester United suffered a 4-0 defeat against Brighton, which ended their hopes of finishing the season in the League's top four. (With input from Reuters)
