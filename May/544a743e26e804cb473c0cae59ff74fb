The People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command resolutely opposes the United States sending its warship through the Taiwan Straits on Tuesday, saying such operation has deliberately undermined peace and stability in the region. The USS Port Royal guided-missile cruiser made a transit through the Taiwan Straits with the U.S. publicly hyping the move, said Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, on Wednesday. The U.S. Navy said in a release that the cruiser went through a corridor in the straits that is not part of the territorial sea of a coastal state. This is the second Taiwan Straits transit completed by a U.S. naval ship in the past two weeks. USS Sampson (DDG-102) went through the straits on April 26. The U.S. has repeatedly staged such provocations, sent a wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" forces, and deliberately increased tensions across the Taiwan Straits, Shi said. The Theater command remains on high alert to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability, he added.
