The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Friday urged the U.S. to stop political manipulation of the COVID-19 pandemic. When asked about China's absence from the second global anti-epidemic summit held online on May 12, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the U.S. insisted on inviting Taiwan authorities to participate in the event despite China's solemn position and the consensus of the international community on the one-China principle. Zhao said China was unable to attend the summit. Noting China welcomes all efforts that help the international community to jointly fight the pandemic in a scientific way, the spokesperson said China has taken the lead in putting forward the vision of building a global community of health for all. He added China has given full play to its advantages, ensuring the stability of the global anti-pandemic materials supply chain, and actively promoting international cooperation on vaccines to help prevent and control the global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is raging across the world and needs to be tackled jointly by all countries, Zhao said, adding China will continue to work with the international community with concrete actions to play an active role in overcoming the COVID-19 pandemic at an early date.
