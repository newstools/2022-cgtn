Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw on Friday said at a press conference that police officers were wrong to wait for room keys and tactical equipment and not immediately breach a classroom door inside the elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, where a gunman killed 19 children and two teachers on Tuesday and injured more than a dozen others. "Obviously, based on the information we have, there were children in that classroom that were still at risk," McCraw said. "From the benefit of hindsight where I'm sitting now, of course, it was not the right decision. It was the wrong decision."
