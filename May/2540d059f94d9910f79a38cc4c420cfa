The Transitional Military Council (TMC) in Chad has announced the postponement of national peace talks scheduled for May 10, as preliminary negotiations between the two sides drag on in Qatar. The talks will now take place "at a later date, which will be decided after consultations with the relevant institutions and political actors," the TMC said in a statement.
