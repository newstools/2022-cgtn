Over 80 U.S.-listed firms have been added to the list of entities facing delisting risk, including China's JD.com, Pinduoduo and Bilibili. The Securities Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday expanded the list under the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act (HFCAA), passed in December 2020, which allows the U.S. regulator to remove companies if they fail to comply with American audit standards for three consecutive years. However, Chinese law prohibits company auditors from providing the same information to U.S. regulators over data security concerns. According to China's Foreign Ministry, the country's securities regulator "has already communicated with U.S. regulators in this regard." "It does not mean that the relevant companies will necessarily be delisted," said Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on Thursday. "Whether these companies will be delisted or not from the U.S. exchanges depends on the progress and results of China-U.S. audit supervision cooperation," said Zhao. Two weeks ago, Fang Xinghai, vice chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said securities watchdogs from the two countries were holding regular talks over audit cooperation. "I'm very confident that we will reach an agreement in the near future," said Fang at the annual Boao Forum for Asia.
