China has just released its inflation figures for April. The National Bureau of Statistics says the consumer price index, or CPI, rose 2.1 percent in April from a year earlier, and 0.4 percent from March. What's the driving force behind it? CGTN spoke to Qu Qiang, assistant director and fellow at the International Monetary Institute of Renmin University of China. Qu said that China is experiencing relatively mild inflation, which is driven by low pork price, and low demand under pressure of the pandemic.
