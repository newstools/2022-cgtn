China-Europe freight trains are known as the "steel camel fleets." Since 2011, they have served as an important link for trade and economic cooperation between the two regions. Operations have continued amid a recent COVID-19 outbreak in central China's Zhengzhou City. Prevention and control measures are in place to ensure the safe transport of goods, including disinfecting all cargo before departure. The number of two-way freight trips reached a record 15,000 in 2021, up 22 percent from the previous year.
