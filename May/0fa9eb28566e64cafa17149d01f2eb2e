Some 15 gunmen opened fire in a hotel and two bars in the central Mexican city of Celaya late on Monday, killing at least 11 people in an apparent gangland shooting, local media said. At least five people were also injured, according to Mexican newspaper El Universal. The attack happened in the gang-ravaged state of Guanajuato at around 10:00 p.m local time (0300 GMT), as armed men started shooting and throwing petrol bombs in the hotel. News website Sin Embargo reported that a piece of cardboard was found at the scene, with a message apparently written by a drug cartel saying it had targeted a rival gang in the attack.
