Ye Ming, a 108-year-old COVID-19 patient, was discharged from Shanghai's Pudong Hospital on May 14 after 32 days of treatment. Ye is the oldest COVID-19 patient in China to have recovered from the disease. As Ye has a history of cerebral infarction and coronary heart disease, the hospital decided to put him in the intensive high-risk care group when he was admitted on April 12. Cardiologists and respiratory experts jointly designed a treatment plan for him.
