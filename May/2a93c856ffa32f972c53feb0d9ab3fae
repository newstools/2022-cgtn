Sri Lanka's Central Bank Governor Nandalal Weerasinghe on Wednesday warned that the economic situation in the country will worsen if political stability is not achieved. The central bank chief said if the current situation continues over the next couple of days, prolonged power cuts as well as massive shortages of fuel and other essential items were possible. He added that he had conveyed to President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and other political leaders that he would step down from his post if the political crisis was not resolved in the coming weeks.
