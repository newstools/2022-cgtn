At the break of dawn, a silent village on a green mountain awakes. Located in east China's Jiangxi Province, it's called Pingxi Village. A Fengshui forest on the Luanlin Mountain is like a crescent embracing the village. For hundreds of years, the village and the forest have lived together in harmony.
