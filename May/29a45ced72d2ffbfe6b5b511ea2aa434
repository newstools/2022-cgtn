Jose Mourinho confessed that even for a manager like him, who played and won on the biggest stages football can offer, reaching the Conference League final with Roma made him feel "special". Tammy Abraham's header gave Roma a 1-0 win over Leicester City on Thursday and a 2-1 aggregate victory to set up a final with Feyenoord in Tirana later this month. It will mark the fifth European final of Mourinho's career over a span of nearly two decades, and he has won all four that he has coached thus far: the 2003 UEFA Cup and 2004 Champions League finals with Porto; the 2010 Champions League final with Inter Milan; and the 2017 Europa League final with Manchester United. Mourinho is already the first coach to reach a UEFA final with four different clubs (Porto, Inter, United and Roma). The Portuguese was seen shedding a tear after the match, and he responded in the post-match press. "I shed a tear because my emotion was for everyone that loves this club. This is a giant club without the trophy room in relation to the social dimension of the club. So this is not a trophy, it's only a final, but means a lot for them and because I lived in this city, I worked in this city for about 11 months I know what it means for them and my emotion was for them."
