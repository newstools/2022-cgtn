China's maternal and infant mortality rates have both dropped to a historical low, the National Health Commission said Monday. In 2021, China recorded a maternal mortality rate of 16.1 per 100,000, said Song Li, head of the Commission's maternal and child health department. At the same time, the mortality rates of infants and children under five have decreased to 5 per thousand and 7.1 per thousand, respectively, both dropping to a record low. Compared to 10 years ago, China's maternal mortality rate and the mortality rates of infants and children under five have dropped by 38 percent, 58 percent and 54 percent, respectively, Song said. Song said the country has made notable achievements in building healthcare mechanisms for women and children, improving related health services and ensuring equal access to these services. There are 3,032 maternal and child healthcare institutions, 793 maternity hospitals and 151 children's hospitals nationwide. The number of obstetrician-gynecologists and pediatricians in the country has grown to 373,000 and 206,000, respectively. Today, thanks to the improvement of the medical system, people in China enjoy more equal access to maternal and child health services, Song said, adding that the rate of women giving birth in hospitals has remained above 99 percent in recent years.
