Fans of Eintracht Frankfurt of Germany and Rangers of Scotland gathered in sunny Seville on Tuesday ahead of the 51st edition of the Europa League final. "It's just something you dream of as a kid that you don't actually think you'd see," said Scott Dowling, a Rangers fan as he prepares to watch his side in their fifth European final. "I think following a Real Madrid, a Manchester United, you expect it. But for us, it is a once-in-a-lifetime thing. So, yeah to win it after losing in Manchester (in 2008) especially when we didn't think we'd see it again, so it's amazing." The German club's fans also spoke about the "dream" of watching their side in their first European final in 42 years. "For us, it would be very, very good if we could win an international competition after 42 years in the Europa League, " said Werner Monschein, a Frankfurt fan, "And that would mean that we then qualify for the Champions League. That would be a dream that we have had for many years and we can fulfill this tomorrow so that would be super." Despite difficulties traveling to Seville, one fan explained his two-day journey from Glasgow in Scotland down to the south of Spain, "I drove down to Dover (England), took the ferry across, through France, down through the Pyrenees and then arrived in Seville about 10 o'clock today."
