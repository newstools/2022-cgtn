The Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola was left to bemoan a late missed chance from Jack Grealish after City were knocked out of the Champions League semi-finals on Wednesday, following another stunning comeback from Real Madrid. Here is Guardiola's reactions after their second-leg semi-final clash against the Spanish La Liga champions. "I had defeats in the Champions League. Always I had defeats so tough, Barcelona against Chelsea, when both games were exceptional and we could not reach the final. And... yeah, it's tough for us, so we cannot deny it. So we were so close to arrive at the Champions League final."
