Real Madrid's players gave their verdict after winning the club's 14th Champions League trophy following a 1-0 win over Liverpool. Captain Marcelo and midfielder Toni Kroos both admitted that this season's win was unlike any of the previous four that the pair have won during their time with the Spanish club. "I don't know the criteria, but Karim has had one of the most incredible seasons to receive the Ballon d'Or and after today…well I don't know the criteria, but I think he'll touch it." said Marcelo, Real Madrid captain on whether Karim Benzema will now win the Ballon d'Or. "I don't think Jurgen needs a message from me, honestly. The game was a disappointed [for him] just as we would have been if we had lost. That's the thing about finals. So you don't worry that this team won't win a lot with this coach because they're just too good for that." Kroos said on Jurgen Klopp and his Liverpool team. Vinicius Jr scored the only goal of the game shortly before the hour mark with Real goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois proving instrumental with a string of saves. "The first thing with Vinicius is this is his credit, isn't it." said Casemiro, "Especially after the first three years it was really hard and we were getting a lot of defeats because he a young kid and we knew that. It's normal to have ups and downs. Even this year he has had some games that were up and down. But he is demonstrating it and he has shown everyone he is a great player." (With input from AP)
