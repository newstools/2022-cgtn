China hopes all parties in the United Nations Security Council will adhere to the general direction of a political solution to the Korean Peninsula issue and actively seek a way out of current impasse. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin outlined this view at a daily press briefing on Thursday, as the UNSC prepares to vote on a U.S. push for strengthened sanctions for the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), which has renewed its ballistic missile launches."Sanctions are a means, not an end, and should serve the goal of a political solution to the peninsula issue," Wang said, adding that the UNSC should play a positive and constructive role in managing the issue.
