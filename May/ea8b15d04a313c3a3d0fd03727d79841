May 19 has been China Tourism Day since 2011. Follow CGTN's camera to enjoy the beautiful natural scenery across China and celebrate the day. China Tourism Day is also geared toward improving public awareness about travel safety, responsible travel, environmentally friendly travel and other good travel practices. While the city of Xi'an in Shaanxi Province is known for its ancient city wall and the Terracotta Warriors, other gray brick walls lining the surrounding valley have sprung to life with colorful and elaborate murals depicting scenes dating back to the Tang Dynasty around 1,200 years ago. The paintings show scenes from daily life, as well as the markets and architecture of that period, when Xi'an served as the capital and witnessed the rise and fall of one of China's greatest dynasties. Street graffiti has evolved to a new level in Harbin, Heilongjiang. Dozens of tree trunks lining a street in the city's Nangang district have been painted with vivid murals featuring cartoonish animals, including a peacock, rabbit, monkey and horse. The murals are painted on tree holes or on the surface where the bark is peeling off to help protect any vulnerable or damaged parts of the trees. Sturdy steeds gallop through the Luan River on the grasslands near Hexigten Banner in Inner Mongolia. Every morning, a dozen of the native horses are herded through the mist as part of a performance on the plains. They run through the first tributary of the Luan River, with herders following closely behind to demonstrate their skills.
