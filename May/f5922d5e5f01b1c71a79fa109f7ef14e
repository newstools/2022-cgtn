Editor's note: "Hidden World of Birds in City" is about exploring a world of birds that usually goes unnoticed in urban spaces. This episode features photographs from Wang Xiaobo, who has been bird-watching near his residential community in Beijing for the past eight years. It's never easy to be a parent and the rule applies to almost every animal. To ensure its chicks to grow up in a safe environment, the little grebe has to be on guard 24 hours a day. Searching for food, building a new nest to keep the family away from stray cats, entertaining its children by being a ferry... are just part of the parent's daily duty. Watch the video below showing the mother busy constructing a temporary nest for the family to stay at night as the original one is too close to the bank due to the declined water level.
