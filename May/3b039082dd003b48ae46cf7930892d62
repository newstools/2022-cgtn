The Chinese Foreign Ministry said on Friday that U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's speech on policy toward China spread false information, exaggerated the "China threat," interfered in China's internal affairs and smeared China's domestic and foreign policies. China has expressed strong dissatisfaction and firm opposition to the speech, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press briefing.
