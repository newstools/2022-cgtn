The Pakistani government and the outlawed Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) have agreed to extend the ceasefire indefinitely and continue negotiations, Pakistani newspaper Dawn reported Tuesday citing sources. The extension in ceasefire, which was to come to an end last night, was yet to be officially announced. TTP was established in 2007 and is an alliance of militant groups based in northwest Pakistan near the border with Afghanistan. There have been on and off ceasefires between it and the Pakistani government over the years.
