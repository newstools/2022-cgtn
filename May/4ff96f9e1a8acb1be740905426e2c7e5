Dusty Baker, manager of the Houston Astros, became the first Black manager in Major League Baseball (MLB) history to achieve 2,000 wins after the Astros beat the Seattle Mariners 4-0 at Minute Maid Park in Houston on Tuesday. "I'm probably one of the luckiest men to ever walk on this earth," Baker said. Having managed for over 29 years, he secured his first win as he led the San Francisco Giants to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals 2-1 on April 6, 1993. Since then, he has helmed the Chicago Cubs, Cincinnati Reds, Washington Nationals and today's Astros. Baker is the 12th manager to reach the 2,000-win milestone in MLB history and the first to lead five different teams to the playoffs, with 40 postseason wins, which ties him with Terry Francona for eighth all time. Moreover, Baker is one of nine managers to take teams from different leagues to the World Series. Unfortunately, the Giants (National League) lost to the Anaheim Angels 4-3 in 2002 and the Astros (American League) lost to the Atlanta Braves 4-2 in 2021, making Baker the only manager in the 2,000-win club without a World Series title. Ten of the other 11 managers have been inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame, and Bruce Bochy, who has won the World Series three times, should have no problem being inducted when he becomes eligible in 2023. Astros players are certain Baker will find himself in Cooperstown. "This should lead straight to the Hall of Fame," catcher Martin Maldonado said. "We know how hard he’s worked, how much of a baseball guy he is, how much he cares, how much he wants to win games. I'm so happy for him," third baseman Alex Bregman said. Baker turns 73 years old on June 15. If he leads the Astros to a World Series title this season, he will surpass Jack McKeon as the oldest manager to do so.
