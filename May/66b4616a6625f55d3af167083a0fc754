The World Health Organization (WHO) awarded Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, with the Nelson Mandela Award for Health Promotion at the 75th World Health Assembly on May 27. Wu was recognized primarily for his pioneering achievements in HIV/AIDS prevention, including setting up outreach programs among sex workers and China's first needle-exchange program, and the first large-scale opioid replacement treatment. Wu's measure has led to a significant decrease in HIV infection among drug users – from half to 1 percent, according to the WHO. "Health promotion among key populations needs to be continued," Wu said upon accepting the award. The Nelson Mandela Award for Health Promotion is awarded to individuals or organizations that have made a significant contribution to health promotion. It was established in South Africa in 2019 and presented annually since 2020.
