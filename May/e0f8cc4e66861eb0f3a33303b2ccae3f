Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam on Monday met John Lee, the HKSAR's six-term chief executive designate. The two discussed restructuring of local government and anti-epidemic response among other things during the meeting. Lee, former chief secretary for administration of the HKSAR government, won a total of 1,416 votes, surpassing the threshold of 750 votes to win the chief executive election of the HKSAR on Sunday. He's scheduled to visit four central government offices in Hong Kong later this afternoon. Speaking at a joint press conference after the meeting, Lam called smooth handover one of the key works of her government. And she also pledged to provide all necessary assistance to the sixth government that will be led by Lee.
