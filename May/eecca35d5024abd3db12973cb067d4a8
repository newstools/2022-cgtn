Syrian rebels killed 10 pro-government fighters in northern Syria on Friday in the deadliest such attack since a truce deal was reached more than two years ago, a war monitor said. It was not immediately clear whether the attack was carried out by the area's dominant jihadist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or other rebel forces, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights stated.
