Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has conceded defeat in the country's federal election, which was held on Saturday. He said in a speech on Saturday night that he had spoken to the opposition leader Anthony Albanese and congratulated him on his victory. The result marks an end to the coalition's nearly-nine-year hold on power as well as Morrison's tenure as prime minister.
