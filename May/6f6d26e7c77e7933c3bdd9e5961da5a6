International Olympic Committee (IOC) President Thomas Bach said on Saturday that the 2032 Brisbane Summer Games will be a significant event not only for Australia but for the entire Pacific region. Visiting Brisbane for the first time since the city was awarded the Games last year, Bach attended an event for outgoing Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates. "I can say because I have been traveling in the meantime in the Pacific, that these Olympic Games will not only be Games in Australia, and for Australia, this will be an Olympic Games with the whole Pacific region," he said. As former world fencing champion, Bach joined an "Olympics Unleashed" session at Yeronga State High School in south Brisbane and fenced against students there. Queensland is the first state to adopt the program in which Olympic athletes engage with students to encourage future sporting stars. "Being witnesses to one of these sessions is really encouraging," Bach said. "It's a great anticipation of these Games, Brisbane 2032. They're all excited, and they're all motivated. It's really a great feeling of Olympic spirit." The IOC has yet to decide whether to include the modern pentathlon in the 2028 Los Angeles Games after athletes wrote to the governing body over the controversial plan to replace horse riding with obstacle racing. Brisbane will become the third Australian city to host the Olympics, after Melbourne in 1956 and Sydney in 2000. (With input from agencies)
