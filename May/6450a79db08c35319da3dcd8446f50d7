Liverpool striker Sadio Mane is targeting a Ballon d'Or and Champions League double, ahead of the Reds meeting Real Madrid in the final in Paris on Saturday. "My target for Liverpool Football Club is four trophies,"  said Mane, "Now we have two and we lost one. Now we have Champions League. Let's win that one and then we will see what happens. But for sure, I will be the most happy to win the Champions League, and plus the Ballon d'Or." Manager Jurgen Klopp recently suggested that winning the Champions League would likely be the prerequisite for Mane if he is to collect this year's Ballon d'Or award. The 30-year-old has had a sensational season thus far for club and country, winning the League Cup and FA Cup with Liverpool, and the Africa Cup of Nations crown with Senegal, as well as sealing a World Cup place for his nation with the winning penalty in a shootout against Egypt. Mane's contract at Anfield runs out in the summer of 2023 and the striker has been linked with a move to Bayern Munich, but he's not prepared to discuss his future until after the Champions League final. "I think the question is a very good question (about possibly moving to Bayern Munich), but for now it is difficult for me to answer. But for sure, I'm very fully focused for the Champions League. Ask me the question after the Champions League and I will answer you," said Mane on if he is flattered by being linked to a move to Bayern Munich. （With input from AP）
