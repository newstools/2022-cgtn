Jordan's King Abdullah II said on Thursday that his half-brother Prince Hamzah, accused of an attempted coup last year, is in a state of "delusion" and will remain under house arrest. "A Royal Decree was issued, approving the recommendation of the council formed in accordance with the Royal Family Law, to restrict the communications, place of residence, and movement of Prince Hamzah," said a statement from the royal palace.
