Hundreds of endangered peach blossom jellyfish, each roughly the size of a coin, were discovered in Zhumadian City, central China's Henan Province on May 13. A local expert said that this is the first time that these freshwater jellyfish have been found in such a large number in the Zhumadian urban area. The rare species, which is under China's top-level state protection, was found in the city's artificial river, attracting residents to appreciate the umbrella-shaped translucent creature.
