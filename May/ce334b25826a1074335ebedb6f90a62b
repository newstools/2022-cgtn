Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said he holds Israeli forces fully responsible for the death of an Al Jazeera journalist on Wednesday. Al Jazeera said its journalist Shireen Abu Akleh was shot and killed while reporting on an army raid in the city of Jenin on Wednesday. Israeli foreign ministry called the death "sad" and offered to investigate the death jointly with the Palestinian authority. "We have offered the Palestinians a joint pathological investigation into the sad death of journalist Shireen Abu Aqla. Journalists must be protected in conflict zones and we all have a responsibility to get to the truth," Israeli Foreign Minister Yair Lapid wrote on Twitter. The Israeli military said it was investigating the death of the journalist and could not rule out an attack by Palestinian gunmen.
