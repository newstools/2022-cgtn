Five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo is training with Portugal ahead of their UEFA Nations League schedule at the start of June. Ronaldo scored 24 goals and registered three assists in 38 appearances for Man United during the 2021-22 campaign, while he has 115 goals in 186 appearances for his country. The 37-year-old missed United's final match of the Premier League campaign with a hip flexor problem, but he is set to return to action on the international stage. The Euro 2016 winners travel to face Spain first on 2nd June, before facing Switzerland and then the Czech Republic. Fernando Santos' 26-man squad will conclude its four-game streak with a final match in Switzerland on June 12. Portugal recorded a 3-2 win over Croatia in their last Nations League fixture at the end of 2020, but they ultimately finished second in League A Group 3 behind France despite picking up 13 points from six matches. Fernando Santos's side booked their spot in the finals of the 2022 World Cup with a playoff victory over North Macedonia at the end of March, with Bruno Fernandes scoring twice in Porto. Portugal's next gathering before the World Cup in Qatar will be in September, with two more Nations League games to play. (With input from AP)
