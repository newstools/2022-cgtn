Over China's May Day holiday, many people chose to spend time in public spaces and cultural venues. But many of these areas in Beijing have cut their visitor capacity due to the city's latest COVID-19 outbreak. At the China Ethnic Museum, which features the architecture of China's ethnic minorities, staff urge visitors via loudspeakers to wear face masks properly and avoid crowding. "I live very close to this park, so I come here often for a walk," said Lin Ying, who visited the park on Wednesday. "Before we enter, we're asked to show PCR nucleic acid test results from within 48 hours. After entering, the staff tells us to wear masks and reminds us to keep them on. It's not convenient to go out of town, so we came to this park. Preventive measures are quite in place here." The venue houses over 430 traditional architectural buildings and 56 museums covering all ethnic groups in China. Ji Shunhua, who displays embroidery in the museum's park area, said she used to operate indoors but has moved outdoors as a virus preventive measure. Visitors can now only view the exhibits from a distance since the display area has been fenced off. "Close contact has been banned so that visitors are safe, and we are safe as well," Ji said. Public parks have always been a go-to choice of many to spend their May Day holiday, and more so now with COVID-19 when there are restrictions on indoor activities. Mu Jing, deputy director of the activity department of the China Ethnic Museum, said the park has ramped up disinfection routines from three rounds to up to eight a day in all public areas. All indoor exhibits have been suspended, and performances moved outdoors a safe distance from visitors. She said visitors have shown a general understanding of the restrictions. With everyone's compliance, she believes the outbreak will soon be over.
