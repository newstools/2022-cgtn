The Chinese delegation to the World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meeting 2022 in Davos, Switzerland, said on Monday that CNN had vilified them in its report related to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. In its report on Monday, CNN claimed the Chinese delegation did not applaud Zelenskyy's speech and walked out. The Chinese delegation solemnly stated that CNN's report was untrue. They told CMG that they were in talks with the International Energy Agency Executive Director Fatih Birol when Zelenskyy was speaking.
