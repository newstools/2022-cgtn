Last month, the DPRK held a military parade to celebrate the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Korean People's Army in Pyongyang, which featured its largest ICBM, the Hwasongpho-17. DPRK leader Kim Jong Un said the country will take further steps to strengthen and develop its nuclear capabilities to the "fastest possible speed," according to the official Korean Central News Agency. Amid stalled denuclearization talks and escalated tensions on the Korean Peninsula, the DPRK conducted over a dozen weapons tests this year, including its first ICBM test since 2017.
