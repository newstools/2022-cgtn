India's men's badminton team made history on Sunday, winning Thomas Cup for the first time by sweeping defending champions Indonesia 3-0 in dominant fashion. India's first singles shuttler Lakshya Sen set the tone for the final with a strong comeback to beat Anthony Sinisuka Ginting in three sets. India's world's No. 8 doubles pair of Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty repeated the pattern in a more dramatic fashion, saving four match points in the second set to beat Mohammad Ahsan and Kevin Sanjaya Sukamuljo 2-1. Indonesia's dreams of their 15th Thomas Cup title and back-to-back championships were dashed when India's Kidambi Srikanth built on the momentum and closed the match against Jonatan Christie in straight sets, delivering a historic victory for India. The next Thomas and Uber Cup will be held in Chengdu, China in 2024.
