Max Verstappen reaped the reward of Charles Leclerc's misfortune to rack up his third straight win this season in Sunday's Spanish Grand Prix and move to the top of the Formula One drivers' standings. Sergio Perez came second for a Red Bull one-two finish at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya where in 2016 Verstappen had opened his F1 account as a teenager. "It's great to finish the race today alongside Checo (Perez) with a first and second place, it was a difficult beginning but a good end," said Verstappen. "It's a great result, we are leading the Constructors Championship so, although I obviously want to win, I have to be realistic and I am happy with the team result," Perez said. Leclerc was sitting comfortably in the lead from pole until lap 23 when a sudden loss of power proved fatal to his Ferrari. Beaten at the start, Verstappen was blown off the circuit and had technical problems, but he overcame them to produce a furious drive aided by his teammate Perez's generosity for his second win at the circuit. George Russell confirmed Mercedes' revival by finishing third. Carlos Sainz of Ferrari came home fourth ahead of seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes. Hamilton was voted "Driver of the Day" with a remarkable fighting comeback drive from 19th to fifth. Alpha Romeo's Chinese racer Zhou Guanyu did not finish the race. In a post-race interview with the formula1.com, Zhou said, "It's disappointing to finish the race ahead of time for the second weekend in a row, especially when we were potentially on the way to a good result. We need to further investigate the issue in detail, both to understand exactly what went on and to prevent it from happening again, since it's hurting us a lot. Until the retirement, I was having a good race, fighting with the midfield guys ahead of me trying to get into the top 10. Let's hope for a better outcome in Monaco, it will be a very interesting weekend." (With input from agencies)
