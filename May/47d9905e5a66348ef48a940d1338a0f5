Chinese researchers have proposed a new strategy for the lever-inspired triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) with ultra-high output for pulse monitoring, according to the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). The strategy provides new paths to improve the output signal, and develop a lever-inspired contact separation TENG by increasing the charge transfer speed, said the CAS. The study has been jointly carried out by teams from the Institute of Mechanics and Beijing Institute of Nanoenergy and Nanosystems, both under the CAS. TENGs can collect mechanical energy extensively through contact initiation and electrostatic induction, thus having great potential to alleviate the energy crisis. The contact separation mode of TENGs is one of the most fundamental and common modes of working. The new study shows great potential for improving the signal of contact separation TENG-based self-powered sensors and energy harvesting devices, said the CAS. The results have been published in the journal Nano Energy.
