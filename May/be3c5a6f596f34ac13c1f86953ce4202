The United States has crossed the threshold of one million deaths from COVID-19, the White House said on Thursday, as cities like New York try to turn the page on the pandemic despite threats of another surge. "Today, we mark a tragic milestone: one million American lives lost to COVID-19," U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that acknowledged the "unrelenting" pain of those who had lost loved ones during the pandemic. He called on residents to "remain vigilant against this pandemic" and said it was "critical" for Congress to fund resources like testing, vaccines and treatments. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. COVID-19 case count rose to 82,223,212, with a total of 998,997 deaths, as of 6:20 a.m. local time (1020 GMT).
