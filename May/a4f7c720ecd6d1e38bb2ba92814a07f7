China's Qieyang Shijie won the women's 20km race walk at the 35th Gran Premio Cantones de La Coruna, a World Athletics Race Walking Tour Gold event held in Spain on Saturday, clinching her third win of the season. Clocking 1:27:50, Qieyang enjoyed an overwhelming win over Peru's Kimberly Garcia. China's Li Maocuo and Ji Haiying finished fifth and sixth respectively. Qieyang's fruitful season started in Dudince, Slovakia, in April, winning the women's 35km race walk in 2:43:06. She went on to win the women's 10km race walk in 43:07 in Madrid, Spain, in May. In the men's event, Spain's home favorites Alvaro Martin and Diego Garcia finished first and second. In March this year, the Athletics Integrity Unit (AIU) announced the disqualification of Elena Lashmanova's gold medal from the women's 20km race walk at the London 2012 Olympics, which automatically promoted Qieyang, the original runner-up, into first place. She now expects to receive a long overdue gold medal. (With input from Xinhua)
