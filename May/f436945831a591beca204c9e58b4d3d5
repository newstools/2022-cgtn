A record number of university students are graduating in China this year, entering a job market dented by the pandemic. Bo Mumeng, a graduate student majoring in computer science, says he has applied to companies including banks, Internet companies like Alibaba and research institutes. Due to the pandemic, he did most of his interviews online. He says online communication is not as good as an in-person interview. And it was harder to understand more about the companies, since they didn't go to schools to introduce themselves like they usually do. According to statistics from the Education Ministry, the number of college graduates in 2022 is expected to reach a record 10.7 million. To ensure the smooth employment of graduates, many universities have come up with new ways to increase the supply of job positions.
