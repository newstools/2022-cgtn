Moscow has launched its annual environmental campaign called ParkArt. In these scenes from TV Brics, trees are decorated with different kinds of illustrations. The artists use acrylic paints, which environmentalists say give a protective layer to wood wounds. Since the campaign began in 2016, more than 200 drawings have adorned the damaged trees.
