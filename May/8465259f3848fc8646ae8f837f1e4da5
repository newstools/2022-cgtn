Twelve members of China's "Earth Summit Mission 2022" expedition team set out early Wednesday morning to summit the 8,848-meter Mount Qomolangma. They will set up the world's highest weather station at 8,800 meters. Thirteen mountaineers arrived at the final camp at 8,300 meters Tuesday night, but one of them was experiencing frostbite on the hand and therefore stayed at the camp. The mountaineer later decided to catch up with the team. Each carrying a load of 10 kilograms, the rest of the team members began their hike to the summit at around 3 a.m. to conduct a series of scientific research tasks.

They are equipped with the most advanced instruments since the country's second comprehensive scientific research on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau in 2017. With the application of advanced technologies, methods and means, the expedition aims to study climate change patterns and the variation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the extremely high altitudes of Mount Qomolangma, hence proposing innovative scientific plans for the protection of the highest peak in the world. The scientists and mountaineers also plan to achieve the automatic observation and data transmission of meteorological gradients in the high altitude area of the mountain and use a high-precision radar to measure the thickness of ice and snow on the summit for the first time.
