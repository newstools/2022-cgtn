Second-seeded German Alexander Zverev and No.4 seed Stefanos Tsitsipas of Greece set up a rematch of their Monte Carlo semifinal and their 11th meeting on tour in Saturday's Madrid Open semifinal in Manolo Santana Stadium. Defending champion Zverev battled through service problems to defeat Canadian Felix Auger-Aliassime, 6-3, 7-5. The 25-year-old German extended his head-to-head series lead to 5-2 against Auger-Aliassime and got revenge for his ATP Cup defeat in January. Earlier on Friday, Tsitsipas overcame a tough three-set test to beat Russian Andrey Rublev 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 to reach a 10th Masters level semifinal. The Greek world No.5 has notched a Tour-leading 27 victories in 2022, reaching the Australian Open semifinals for a third time and the Rotterdam final, in addition to his Monte Carlo title run. The 23-year-old leads 7-3 against Zverev, including 3-0 on clay. The German is seeking a sixth Masters trophy and a 10th title at that level. The 25-year-old has won Madrid twice, in 2018 and 2021. The world No.3 has won more ATP Masters 1000 titles than any active player outside Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Andy Murray.
