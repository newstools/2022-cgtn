Polling booths have opened for Australia's federal election, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison fighting for another three-year term that would extend a decade of conservative rule. The ballot boxes will be open to millions of Australians across the country from 8:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. local time on Saturday, when counting will begin.
