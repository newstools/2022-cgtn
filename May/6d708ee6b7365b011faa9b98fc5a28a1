Starting from May 15, applications will be moved online for living allowance for the financially challenged disabled population and nursing care subsidies for those living with severe disabilities. The new rule will alleviate the pressure of on-site visits for people living with disabilities, according to a statement jointly released by the Ministry of Civil Affairs and China Disabled Persons' Federation (CDPF). According to the statement, qualified candidates could apply for the two types of subsidies in the government offices nearest to them, regardless of the location of their registered residence as of April last year. When the new rule comes into effect, people can still lodge applications in person, the statement said. China started to grant the two types of subsidies for qualified candidates in 2016. By the end of April 2022, around 12 million financially challenged disabled people and more than 15 million people living with severe disabilities had benefited from the policy. Sunday was China's National Day for Helping the Disabled, an occasion when special activities are launched to raise public awareness about helping the vulnerable group. The day falls on the third Sunday in May in China. According to the CDPF, the country has about 85 million disabled people. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period (2016-2020), some 1.81million jobs were offered to people with disabilities in urban and rural areas, and an average of 400,000 disabled people participated in government-subsidized vocational training programs each year, according to the CDPF. The country will continue to increase employment opportunities for the disabled in the fields of culture and art, mental health and internet services, an action plan issued by the State Council said.
