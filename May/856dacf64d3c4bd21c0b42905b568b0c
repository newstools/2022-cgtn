A team of 13 professional Tibetan mountaineers will attempt to reach the peak of Mount Qomolangma, also known as Everest in the West, on Wednesday, May 4, as part of China's "Earth Summit Mission 2022." The climbers will set out from camp at an altitude of 8,300 meters at 3 a.m. local time, with automated weather stations and an array of radar equipment. The team is expected to mount the crest at 8 a.m. local time on Wednesday. It is said to be the most important journey on this scientific expedition. The mountaineers and plateau researchers have a fairly well-established relationship from years of collaboration on research at extremely high altitudes. The mission's success will be record-setting, as the mountaineers are tasked to install the world's highest automatic weather station at 8,800 meters above sea level, aiming to help scientists better understand the world's "third pole". CGTN spoke with lead mountaineer Dechen Ngodrup about the challenges of the team's work.
