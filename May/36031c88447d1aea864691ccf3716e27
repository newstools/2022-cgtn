Two Palestinians armed with axes attacked passers-by in central Israel on Thursday night, killing at least three people and wounding four others before fleeing the scene in Elad, a Jewish ultra-Orthodox city east of Tel Aviv, Israeli authorities said. "We are on a manhunt for the terrorists," Israeli police spokesman Eli Levi said in a briefing to reporters. (With input from Xinhua)
