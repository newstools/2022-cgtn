Chinese Premier Li Keqiang asked for details on how to implement the policies aimed at stabilizing the economy during a State Council meeting on Wednesday. The premier required that the details must be sorted out before the end of May. Li said the government is facing difficulties in development, some of which are more serious than those in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic hit. Li told the meeting that development is the key to solving all current problems. In order to make sure the half-year targets are met, Li asked the government to better balance between economic development and COVID-19 control, while safeguarding employment and the running of market entities. He said resolving the current dilemmas is a test of government's abilities and asked local governments to employ all possible methods to help enterprises. The State Council will inspect the implementation of policies, Li told the meeting, adding that the National Bureau of Statistics will disclose the second quarter economic parameters according to law.
