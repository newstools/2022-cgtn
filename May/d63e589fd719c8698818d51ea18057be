World No. 2 Daniil Medvedev fell to a 6-2, 7-6(5) defeat by French veteran Richard Gasquet at the Geneva Open on Tuesday on his return to the ATP tour, having spent six weeks recovering from a hernia operation. The loss in the round of 16 means the U.S. Open champion is left short of practice ahead of next week's French Open. The 26-year-old Russian underwent surgery last month after losing in the quarterfinals in Miami, missing the early clay-court season. "Clay for my body is the most dangerous surface. For me it's clay courts – every time, every year I have some problems where I cannot be 100 percent," he said. "I'm not a favorite for Roland-Garros but I do want to play well. If I can find my level again, I can be dangerous," Medvedev added. It was the first time 35-year-old Gasquet had defeated a top two player since beating Roger Federer in 2005 – his only other victory over a top-two opponent in 38 attempts. World No. 75 Gasquet faces Poland's Kamil Majchrzak in the quarterfinals after the latter beat Italian qualifier Marco Cecchinato 6-2, 6-3. Last year's Geneva winner Casper Ruud, runner-up Denis Shapovalov and Reilly Opelka are the other top 20 players still in the Geneva draw. The 2020 U.S. Open winner Dominic Thiem lost to Cecchinato in the first round.
