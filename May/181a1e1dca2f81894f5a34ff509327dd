Veteran forward Olivier Giroud was left out of the France squad and uncapped Marseille midfielder Boubacar Kamara summoned on Thursday for Nations League games. AC Milan striker Giroud, who is on the verge of winning the Italian league, is only three behind Thierry Henry's national scoring record of 51 goals. "I want to offer the possibility to other offensive players who are very efficient with their club and who have had less playing time (with the French team) to be able to give them the opportunity to sharpen their skills and have more playing time." Said Didier Deschamps, France head coach. Defending champion France have four games in June. They host Denmark on June 3, travel to Croatia on June 6 and Austria on June 10, then return home to play Croatia on June 13. Deschamps did not rule out the 35-year-old Giroud being selected for the World Cup this year. The 53-year-old also wants to give more game time to forwards such as Monaco striker Wissam Ben Yedder - who has 24 league goals - and Christopher Nkunku, who netted 20 for Leipzig. The 22-year-old Kamara is a versatile player and can also play central defence. He earned his shot after playing well for Marseille, who are third in the French league, and his presence gives Deschamps cover for injured midfielder Paul Pogba. (With input from AP)
