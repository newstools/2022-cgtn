The New York Liberty lost to the Dallas Wings 81-71 in the WNBA game at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn borough, New York City on Friday. Chinese center Han Xu, in her second game for the Liberty this season, scored 10 points, two rebounds, two assists, two steals and one block off the bench. With the league's top height of 2.06 meters, Han was able to post up in the paint, but she could also make contributions from outside. Having shot 4-of-7 from the field, including 1-for-2 at the 3-point line, Han held +1 in plus-minus in Sunday's game, the highest of the team and she was the only plus player of the Liberty. Though Han played both of her games off the bench, she was very efficient on offense, getting a total of 20 points in less than 24 minutes. "I'm always ready to play and I have no pressure starting off the bench," Han said after her season debut in the game against the Chicago Sky on May 11. "I want to thank my teammates for helping me overcome the language and cultural barriers." Han's national team teammate Li Yueru is reportedly waiting for her work visa so she can join the Sky. In an interview on May 14, Han said she wants her story to encourage more Chinese players to come to the WNBA. "I have acquired both knowledge and systematic training during my growth in school, which makes feel very lucky," she said. "I want to influence more young players with my daily hard-working and see more Chinese girls join the WNBA. Let's work, grow and promote the development of world basketball together." "My favorite basketball player is Zheng Haixia who competed in the WNBA before. Her fighting spirit has been encouraging me all the time. She had remarkable interior dominance and I want to become a player like her," Han added.
