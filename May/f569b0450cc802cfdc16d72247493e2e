China's central bank said on Friday it will launch a 100-billion-yuan ($15 billion) relending facility soon to support the transport, logistics and storage sectors. The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said the funds will help resolve "pain points and difficulties in epidemic prevention and control." The central bank will "constantly optimize its structural monetary policy system," the PBOC said in a WeChat statement. "Monetary policy should coordinate with fiscal and industrial policies to jointly boost the confidence of market players, stimulate market drivers, support the real economy and achieve the goal of stable growth," the bank said. The announcement came after the PBOC announced on Wednesday that it had increased the targeted re-lending quota for the coal industry by an additional 100 billion yuan to aid clean energy development.
