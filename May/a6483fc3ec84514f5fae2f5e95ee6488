Chinese Vice Premier Sun Chunlan on Monday called for adhering to the dynamic zero-COVID policy and taking more thorough measures to cut off all COVID-19 transmission chains in communities. Sun made the remarks during an inspection tour in Beijing. She called for greater effort in strengthening epidemiological investigation and tracing, transferring and quarantine to ensure the health and safety of the people and the normal order of production and life. The current pandemic situation in Beijing remains controllable overall, but there have been sporadic cases in a few localities, Sun said, adding that the COVID-19 containment efforts cannot be slackened. She also called for efforts to move faster to handle cluster cases and properly organize nucleic acid testing to detect infections early and ensure that people's basic living and medical needs are met. Beijing continues to take measures to contain the pandemic as the number of new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases is still increasing. The capital city reported 63 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases between 3 p.m. on Sunday and 3 p.m. on Monday, bringing the total number of infections to more than 1,550 since April 22.
