U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris has called for a ban on assault weapons. She made the remarks after leaving a funeral of one of the victims of the Buffalo supermarket shooting in New York state on May 14 this year. Harris says the U.S. is experiencing 'an epidemic of hate' and she says assault weapons are weapons of war that had no place in civil society.
