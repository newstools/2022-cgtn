Liverpool play Real Madrid on Saturday in the UEFA Champions League final at Stade de France in Paris. It will be their third meeting in a European Cup final, with the English side beating Real 1-0 in 1981 before suffering a 3-1 loss in 2018. The Reds' Mohamed Salah was injured in a clash with Sergio Ramos in the first half four years ago, resulting in the early substitution of the Egyptian star. Liverpool fans believe they would have won if Salah had remained on the pitch. Liverpool, who trained on Friday for the final time ahead of the final, were boosted by midfielder Thiago's return to fitness.Thiago limped out of the final Premier League game of the season and had seemed doubtful with an Achilles injury. His recovery has given German manager Jurgen Klopp a dilemma over his midfield combination as Fabinho also trained freely after a hamstring strain. Klopp said Real's history in the Champions League makes them favorites for Saturday's final but added that if his team are "at the top of their game they are really difficult to beat." "My only concern is that we could be ourselves," he said on Friday. (With input from AP)
