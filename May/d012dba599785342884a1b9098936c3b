Briton Simon Yates of Bike Exchange made a storming time trial to win the second stage of the Giro d'Italia while Mathieu van der Poel kept hold of the pink jersey in Hungary on Saturday. The 29-year-old is one of the title favorites, and clocked 11 minutes, 50 seconds on the 9.2km course through Budapest that included a steep uphill finish. It was only Yates' second time trial success and his first in a grand tour. "For sure this is my best time trial victory," Yates said. "Of course really happy, a little bit unexpected but I'll take them as they come. "I was never confident, Van der Poel was close as well, but you always have that belief you would win and I managed to hang on." Van der Poel won Friday's opening stage and claimed the race's first maglia rosa on his debut in the Italian grand Tour. The Dutch cyclist who rides for Alpecin-Fenix finished three seconds behind Yates but retained his lead in the overall standings by 11 seconds from Yates. Van der Poel's compatriot Jumbo's Tom Dumoulin was third, five seconds behind Yates. He was also the third overall at 16 seconds after the tight inner-city run, the second of three stages in Hungary before a switch to Italy. (With input from AP)
