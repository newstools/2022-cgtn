Nansha District in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province, is at the forefront of a cross-border startup boom. It's the geographic center of the Greater Bay Area economic hub and home to the province's largest free-trade ports. Entrepreneurs from the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region are showered with government support there, from plush office space to living stipends and access to investors and trade officials. For young Hong Kong residents coming from humble backgrounds, such incentives give them much-needed courage to chase their dreams.
