Sixteen people were injured at the Barclays Center in New York City on Sunday morning after false reports of an active shooter spread through the crowd at a boxing match. A stampede occurred around 1:05 a.m. as the Gervonta Davis-Rolando Romero boxing match was wrapping up, according to a New York City Police Department (NYPD) spokesperson. Seven people were transported to local hospitals, and the remaining nine injured were treated on-site by medical staff, the NYPD said. It's unclear what exactly prompted the report of an active shooter.
