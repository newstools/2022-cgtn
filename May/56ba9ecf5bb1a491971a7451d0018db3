At least 10 people were killed and three others injured in a mass shooting at a supermarket in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Buffalo, New York State on Saturday, before the suspect was taken into custody, authorities said. Officials said the suspected gunman, a white 18-year-old male, was wearing tactical gear and traveled several hours to Buffalo to carry out the attack, which he livestreamed on social media. "At approximately 2:30 today, an individual who the mayor stated is not from this area and is from hours away, drove to Buffalo and went to ... the Tops market. He exited his vehicle, he was very heavily armed. He had tactical gear. He had a tactical helmet on. He had a camera that he was livestreaming what he was doing," Buffalo Police Commissioner Joseph Gramaglia said. The suspect, identified as Payton Gendron, was charged with first-degree murder and arraigned in Hannah's courtroom, Buffalo City Court Chief Judge Craig Hannah said. Eleven of the 13 people who were shot were Black and the FBI is investigating the mass shooting as a hate crime and racially motivated violent extremism. The White House released a statement after President Joe Biden has been briefed on the deadly mass shooting by the homeland security advisor. "Tonight, we grieve for the families of ten people whose lives were senselessly taken and everyone who is suffering the physical and emotional wounds of this horrific shooting... A racially motivated hate crime is abhorrent to the very fabric of this nation... Hate must have no safe harbor. We must do everything in our power to end hate-fueled domestic terrorism," the statement said.
