Dallas Mavericks superstar Luka Doncic had 26 points and 13 rebounds, and his team turned up the defensive pressure to get back in their Western Conference semifinal series with top-seeded Phoenix, beating the Suns 103-94 on Friday. The Mavericks spoiled Chris Paul's 37th birthday, forcing the 17-year pro into his most turnovers in any half of a playoff game with seven before the break. Dallas cut the Suns' series lead to 2-1 and ended an 11-game losing streak against Phoenix, regular season included. Game 4 is on Sunday in Dallas. Paul didn't have any more turnovers after halftime, but the Suns finally struggled with their shooting when they weren't turning it over. Phoenix shot 45 percent, ending a run of at least 50 percent shooting in the playoffs at eight games. "It felt like all seven of them were back to back to back," said Paul, whose career high for a game in the playoffs is eight turnovers. "If I don't turn the ball over like that I feel like it's a different game." Meanwhile, star center Joel Embiid returned from a facial injury as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Miami Heat 99-79 in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Falling 0-2 behind, Danny Green and Tyrese Maxey each scored 21 points to lead Sixers' box score, and Embiid, in black mask, had 18 points and 11 rebounds. James Harden also crushed Heat rallies with big buckets, dropping 17 points, eight rebounds, and six assists. Embiid – who led the 76ers with 30.6 points and 11.7 rebounds this season – is still playing with a right thumb ligament injury that will require offseason surgery, but made a difference in Game 3 just by his presence. Miami All-Star center Bam Adebayo, who scored 24 points in Game 1 and 23 in Game 2, was held to just five in the first half. Jimmy Butler scored 33 points, Tyler Herro added 14 for the Heat. Game 4 is Sunday in Philadelphia. (With input from agencies)
