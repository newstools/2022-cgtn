The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) on Wednesday said that after checking with the U.S. investigators involved in the airplane crash probe, the U.S. side said they did not give out any information concerning the ongoing investigation. Investigators and technical advisers from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) are currently working with China on the investigation, along with other parties including Boeing Co. and 737-800 engine maker CFM. A China Eastern Airlines jetliner crashed in March, killing all 132 people onboard.
