May 12th marks International Day of Plant Health which is designated by the United Nations to raise global awareness for safety of plants. Plants make up 98% of the oxygen we breath and 80% of the food we eat. But many of them are under threat due to spreading diseases and pests. Protecting plant health can help reduce poverty, promote diversity and end hunger as well as boost economic development. Let's take a look at some of amazing plant species around the world and appreciate the life of earth that we are all dependent on.
