The Green Bay Packers are finalizing a multi-year contract extension with their cornerback Jaire Alexander. His agent John Thornton told ESPN's Adam Schefter the new deal is for four years, $84 million that includes a signing bonus of $30 million, both mark a new record for defensive backs. Having been drafted by the Packers with the 18th pick in 2018, Alexander has been growing fast and was named for Pro Bowl as well as the Second-team All Pro in 2020. In his first three seasons in the team, he was the leader in pass breakups and ranked fourth in the league behind only James Bradberry, Stephon Gilmore and Janoris Jenkins, according to ESPN Stats & Information data. Last season, Alexander suffered a shoulder injury in Week 4 and, as a result, missed all of the following regular season games. He managed to return in the National Football Conference Divisional game against the San Francisco 49ers. Unfortunately, the Packers lost 13-10 at home. "He's such a big part of what we're doing; he's been such a good player for us since the day he kind of arrived," Packers general manager Brian Gutekunst said of Alexander. "We'd love for [an extension] to happen. Certainly we've been in communication with his representation and we will continue to be as we go through the year." By reaching the extension with Alexander, the Packers managed to lower his base salary for the 2022 season to $1.076 million, creating more cap space in addition to the $11 million they already have. The Packers signed a four-year, $200 million extension with their quarterback Aaron Rodgers who was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player last season. They also kept All-Pro linebacker De'Vondre Campbell. However, the team traded five-time Pro-Bowl wide receiver Davante Adams to the Las Vegas Raiders for draft picks. It's logical to assume the Packers will use the salary space they have to make enhancements in this position.
