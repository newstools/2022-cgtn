On May 1, International Workers Day, dozens of community-based organizations, unions and allies took to the streets of New York City to demand stronger worker protections and a full pathway to citizenship for immigrants. "The pandemic disproportionately impacted Black and brown communities; many were pushed to the frontlines as essential workers to provide for their families and our communities. In times of need, our most impacted and vulnerable communities are left to fend for themselves and are excluded from state support as well as from a pathway to citizenship," the event page said. CGTN stringer interviewed the protesters. They say many workers in the United States are immigrants who are often exploited because of their status or language barriers. They are calling for unions to unite to fight for their rights.
