Clint Dempsey was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame on Saturday. The class of 2022 also included Shannon Boxx, Clint Dempsey and Linda Hamilton, three-time Major League Soccer champion Marco Etcheverry and FIFA international referee Esse Baharmast. "I want to thank the U.S. National Team cause as a kid, that's what I dreamed about," said Dempsey, "All I wanted to do was play for this country. I wanted to score goals in the World Cup – that was the biggest dream for me – and to be able to have an opportunity to do that and, now, to be recognized as, you know, among some of the best players to ever do it is truly an honor. I especially want to thank Jurgen Klinsmann for making me captain in 2014, giving me an opportunity to captain my country in a World Cup is something that I will be able to remember for the rest of my life." Dempsey, a three-time U.S. Soccer Federation Player of the Year, is tied with Landon Donovan for the U.S. record of 57 international goals. Donovan made 141 appearances for the national team from 2004-2017. He played for New England (2004-2006), Fulham (2007-2012), Tottenham (2012-2013) and Seattle (2013-2018), and his 82nd-minute chip against Juventus put Fulham into the 2010 Europa League quarterfinals.
