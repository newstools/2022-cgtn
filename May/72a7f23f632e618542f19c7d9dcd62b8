The Iranian Revolutionary Guards have confirmed that Colonel Sayyad Khodai was shot dead outside his Tehran home on Sunday, and blamed his assassination on assailants linked to the United States and its allies. The killing is the most high profile murder inside Iran since the November 2020 killing of top nuclear scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh.
