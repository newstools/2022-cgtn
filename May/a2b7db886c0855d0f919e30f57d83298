A 76.8-meter tall tree was found in Gelin Village, Medog County in southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, breaking the previous record of a 72-meter Taiwania (Taiwania cryptomerioides Hayata) on Gaoligong Mountain in Yunnan Province, according to the Medog Forestry and Grassland Administration. The tree, Bhutan Pine (Pinus bhutanica), is currently the tallest known tree on the Chinese mainland. A variety of epiphytic protection plants and Medog endemic plants were found on the tree. Eight giant Bhutan pine trees ranging from 70.2 meters to 76.8 meters tall were found in the village. The area has the largest distribution of giant trees on the Chinese mainland and fully reflects the authenticity of forest ecosystems in the Yarlung Zangbo Grand Canyon area. Bhutan pine is a species only distributed in the eastern Himalayas. It is mainly found in mountain rainforests and subtropical climate zones at an altitude of 1,400 meters to 2,500 meters, which has excellent hydrothermal conditions and biodiversity.
