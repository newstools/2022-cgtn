Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced on Sunday that Tokyo and Washington were expected to reach agreement on transforming part of a U.S. base in Okinawa Prefecture into a public space, in a bid to reduce the burden to local region. His announcement came on the same day when a ceremony was being held in Naha to mark the 50th anniversary of the return of Okinawa from U.S. control to Japanese sovereignty.
