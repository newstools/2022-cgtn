China successfully launched Tianzhou-4 on Tuesday, a cargo spacecraft carrying supplies to its under-construction space station. The Long March-7 Y5 rocket topped with the cargo ship blasted off early Tuesday from the Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site in south China's coastal Hainan Province. The mission will prepare the space station for the arrival of its next astronaut crew, scheduled for June.
