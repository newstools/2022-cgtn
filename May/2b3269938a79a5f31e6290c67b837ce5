A Palestinian teenager was killed on Friday in fresh clashes with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank, Palestinian authority said. Zeid Ghuneim, 15, was killed after he was shot by Israeli soldiers in the neck and back during clashes in the town of al-Khader, near the West Bank city of Bethlehem, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Israel later said its soldiers were pursuing “suspects who hurled stones and Molotov cocktails” at them near the settlement of Efrat and chased the suspects to al Khader. Soldiers opened fire during the clashes but the Israeli military could not confirm whether Ghnaim was a member of the firebomb-throwing gang or a bystander, the Times of Israel reported. Meanwhile, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society reported that more than 90 Palestinians were injured during protests and clashes with Israeli soldiers in the villages of Burqa, Beit Dajan, Beita and Huwara. Palestinians organized rallies and protests on Friday against the Israeli government's policies of expanding settlements and confiscation of lands, and the demonstrations often lead to clashes with Israeli soldiers.
