A fire broke out in the early hours on Monday at Mahamuni refugee camp, which reportedly hosts thousands of refugees in Kyauktaw town in Myanmar's Rakhine State, according to local media. The blaze, which was apparently sparked by a candle according to local witnesses, was extinguished at around 3:00 a.m. after destroying approximately 300 homes. It was not immediately clear how many people were affected or if there were any casualties.
