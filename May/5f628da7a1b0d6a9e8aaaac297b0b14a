A medical team from Hunan Province has contributed to the treatment of critical patients in Shanghai's ongoing battle against COVID-19. Upon arrival, the team took over the intensive care units at two designated hospitals in Shanghai's Huangpu District and took on the task of saving lives. Most ICU patients are seniors with serious underlying illnesses that increase the difficulty of treatment and nursing. The team quickly worked out situation-based treatment plans after taking over the ICU departments. ICU departments in the two hospitals have so far received 66 patients whose average age is over 80. A total of 39 patients have been transferred out of the ICU and nine have been discharged after recovering.
