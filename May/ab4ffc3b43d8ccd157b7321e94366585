The Iranian military has unveiled a drone base underneath the Zagros mountain range, as well as two new types of cruise missiles in a television program aired on Saturday. The base, which hosts 100 drones, is located hundreds of meters underground, according to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). The released television footage of the base shows various models of drones armed with missiles lining up in a tunnel. The military also showcased two new types of cruise missiles – the Heidar-1 and the Heidar-2. The Heidar-1 is Iran's first cruise missile capable of being fired from a drone, with a range of 200 kilometers, while the Heidar-2 can be launched from a helicopter. IRNA reported that armed forces chief of staff General Mohammad Bagheri and army commander Abdolrahim Mousavi visited the underground site on Saturday to learn about the latest development on drones. The Iranian military is rapidly developing its drone force, building new drones capable of performing a variety of missions, according to Bagheri.
