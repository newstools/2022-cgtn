China's first fully self-driving sanitation vehicles have been undergoing open road tests in Guangzhou's Nansha District since May 2022. These vehicles have no cockpit, no steering wheel, no throttle and no brake pedal. In the future, they will be able to provide driverless solutions for cities to respond to special public health events.
