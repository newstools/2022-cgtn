World champion Max Verstappen roared to an authoritative victory for Red Bull Racing on Sunday when he beat Ferrari's Charles Leclerc in sweltering conditions at a celebrity-packed inaugural Miami Grand Prix. The 24-year-old Dutchman took the lead from the pole-sitting Monegasque driver on the opening lap and remained in control throughout a largely processional contest. He came home 3.78 seconds ahead of Leclerc for his third Grand Prix win this year and the 23rd of his career. Carlos Sainz finished third in the second Ferrari after holding off a late charge from Sergio Perez, on fresh tires in the second Red Bull, and George Russell came home fifth ahead of Mercedes teammate seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton. "What a race," said Verstappen, who had missed most of Friday's practice sessions when he had a gearbox replaced after an early brush with the barriers. "It was nice, but it was a tough one, but really good. The team did an outstanding job – a good recovery we can be proud of... I think I need a drink and I think you need a drink!" Alpha Romeo's Chinese racer Zhou Guanyu was forced to retire from the race due to a technical problem. "Unfortunately, we had to retire the car, we had a technical problem. I’m not sure exactly what happened, but we have to investigate," Zhou said. (With input from AFP)
