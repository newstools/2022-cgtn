At least 11 people have died in floods and mudslides triggered by heavy rains in Assam, India's remote northeast region, local media reported, citing officials on Tuesday. Several railway stations were closed because of floods, said Nazreen Ahmed, a senior official in Assam's Dima Hasao district. She said nearly 200,000 people in the district were cut off from the rest of the state as roads and bridges were either blocked by landslides or washed away. Rescue operations are ongoing in the affected area.
