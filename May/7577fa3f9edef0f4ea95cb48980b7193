Manchester City have been handed a fine by UEFA due to the 'improper conduct' of their players during the quarter-final second-leg match with Atletico Madrid at Wanda Metropolitano, where a goalless draw sent the Premier League side through to the next round. Late in the match, and with City leading by 1-0 on aggregate, a melee broke out between both sets of the players, which was sparked by Atletico defender Stefan Savic. Both sides appeared to be involved in several altercations and Savic got in a prolonged battle with Jack Grealish and Raheem Sterling, after dragging Phil Foden from the ground. The incident continued into the tunnel, as footage later emerged of Atletico defender, Šime Vrsaljko firing saliva at City members and making desperate attempts to engage in physical altercations. One month after the hot contest, City was fined 14,000 euros (£11,910) for the "improper conduct of the team" during the Champions League draw with Atletico. Pep Guardiola’s men didn’t make it to the final as they were knocked out by the other team in the Spanish capital, Real Madrid from the semi-final. A dramatic 4-3 win in the first-leg ultimately wasn't enough to see City set up an all-England final against Liverpool, as Carlo Ancelotti's Real won 3-1 in the second leg, reaching the final with a 6-5 aggregate scoreline, thanks to another superb performance from Karim Benzema.
