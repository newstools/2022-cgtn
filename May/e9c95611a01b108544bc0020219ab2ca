The European Union's Iran nuclear talks envoy's recent discussions in Tehran went "better than expected," the bloc's foreign policy chief said on Friday. Speaking on the sidelines of a Group of Seven (G7) foreign ministers' meeting in northern Germany, the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said "the negotiations were blocked and they have been de-blocked" and that means there is "a prospect of reaching a final agreement." Enrique Mora, the EU's coordinator on Iran nuclear talks, visited Tehran this week to discuss the Vienna talks aimed at reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal. Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers in July 2015, agreeing to put some curbs on its nuclear program in return for the removal of the U.S.-led sanctions. However, former U.S. President Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the agreement in May 2018 and reimposed unilateral sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to reduce some of its nuclear commitments under the JCPOA. Since April 2021, eight rounds of talks have been held in Vienna between Iran and the remaining JCPOA parties – China, Britain, France, Russia and Germany – to revive the pact.
