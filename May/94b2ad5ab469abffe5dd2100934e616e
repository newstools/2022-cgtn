At least 15 asylum seekers were killed late Monday in a new attack by militiamen of the rebel group "Congo Economic Development Cooperative" in a camp for Internally displaced people (IDP) in the Djugu territory of Ituri Province, in northeastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to local sources. According to local civil society leader Dieudonne Lossa, the victims are mostly children in an IDP camp in the locality of Lodda, which accommodates asylum seekers fleeing violence in the surrounding villages.
