The Chengdu 2021 World University Games have been rescheduled again to 2023, the International University Sports Federation (FISU) announced on Friday. "The decision to reschedule Chengdu 2021 is not one that was made easily, but it is the right decision for university athletes. Their welfare is always our number one priority. Continued uncertainty over conditions has made rescheduling the sensible choice – a number of National University Sports Federations had already changed their plans," Acting FISU President Leonz Eder said in a statement. "Taking a team to the FISU World University Games is a great responsibility and FISU is confident that this decision will enable the greatest possible number of university athletes to attend next year." This edition of World University Games was scheduled to happen in 2021 but was delayed for the first time due to the postponement of the 2022 Tokyo Olympics. The FISU expressed thanks to the Chengdu Organizing Committee for the preparation efforts. "FISU thanks the Chengdu Organizing Committee for its hard work," Eder said. The 2023 Winter World University Games will take place in Lake Placid, New York. The Rhine-Ruhr area of Germany and Torino in Italy are scheduled to host the Summer and Winter World University Games respectively in 2025.
