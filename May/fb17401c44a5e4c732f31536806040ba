Jaú National Park in Brazil is the largest forest reserve in South America and one of the richest areas in terms of biodiversity. The name "Jaú" comes from one of the largest fish in Brazil, the gilded catfish or jau. CMG reporter Wang Bo explores the Amazon rainforest, plays with Amazon River dolphins and discovers fantastic plants at this UNESCO World Heritage Site.
