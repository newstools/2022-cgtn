China will have 5.5 million nurses by 2025, according to a new plan released on Monday by the National Health Commission. This will mean an average of 3.8 registered nurses for every 1,000 people, the development plan for nursing showed. In 2020, China had 4.7 million registered nurses, up 45 percent from 2015. Over 70 percent have a junior college degree or above, said the document. Among its main objectives, the plan said it wants to improve nationwide nursing resources allocation, provide legal protection to nurses, promote the high-quality development of the nursing industry and rapidly develop the elderly care system. The plan also aims to enhance the digitalization of care data through technologies such as cloud computing, big data, the internet of things, blockchain and mobile internet to improve the infrastructure for an internet-aided care system. Improvements in nursing are of great significance to better people's health and actively respond to an aging population, the document said. (With input from Xinhua)
