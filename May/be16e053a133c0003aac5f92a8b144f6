Beichangtan village, located in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, is a remote village on the side of the Yellow River. The village used to be very remote due to its lack of communication with and access to the outside world. But now with more roads built, more people can visit the village easily. During April and May, many pear flowers bloom, attracting visitors eager to admire the natural beauty in this quiet and wild place.
