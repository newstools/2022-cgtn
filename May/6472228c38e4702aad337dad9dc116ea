A ninth survivor was rescued on Tuesday morning from the collapsed residential building in Changsha in central China's Hunan Province. The survivor, a female, was lucid and had stable vital signs, rescuers said before she was pulled out of the rubble and sent to the hospital. Rescue operations have been underway after the eight-story building in Wangcheng District, Changsha, with a floor area of about 700 square meters, toppled on Friday. At least 39 people went missing, and 23 people were trapped under the rubble. Police have detained nine people, including the owner of the building and three others in charge of its construction. Another five were charged with creating a false safety report for the building. The exact cause of the collapse is still under investigation, but it is reported that the tenants had made structural changes to the building. The Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development said that a comprehensive and thorough investigation on illegally constructed buildings for business operations will be conducted across the country.
