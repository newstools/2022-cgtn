Founded in 1871, the National Rifle Association (NRA) is the largest pro-gun lobby in the United States. In 1975, it set up a lobbying arm to influence government policy. Two years later, it began to channel funds to lawmakers. In 2020, its annual spending reached about $250 million. Officially, the NRA spends around $3 million every year to influence gun laws.
