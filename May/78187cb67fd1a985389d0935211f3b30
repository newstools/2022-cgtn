Israel reopened its only crossing with the Gaza Strip to Palestinian workers on Sunday, nearly two weeks after closing it over unrest, the Defense Ministry said. "Following an assessment of the security situation, it has been decided... to open Erez Crossing for passage of workers and permit holders from the Gaza Strip into Israel, beginning Sunday," said COGAT, a unit of the Israeli Defense Ministry responsible for Palestinian civil affairs.
