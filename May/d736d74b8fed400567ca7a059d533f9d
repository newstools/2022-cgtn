Luka Modric said he wishes to end his career at Real Madrid during the Marca Legend Award ceremony that took place in the Spanish capital on Wednesday. "What happens at the Bernabeu on Champions League nights is something... something really... it's magical. We never surrender. We fight until the end, and that's what Real Madrid teaches us, to never give up. Really, this is so hard to explain, especially this season, with so many magical nights," said the veteran midfielder. The award recognizes the outstanding achievements of the world's most special athletes with Modric joining the club alongside others like Michael Jordan, Lionel Messi, Muhammad Ali, Cristiano Ronaldo, Fernando Alonso, Rafael Nadal, Ronaldo Nazario, Pele, Niki Lauda and Johan Cruyff amongst others. Modric joined Real from English Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur in 2012 and soon became a stellar player for Los Blancos. "Real Madrid is my home. I’m very happy at this club. I'm very happy in the city and I feel loved by the fans. My family is also very happy here. This is why I wish I will stay here many more years and hopefully end my career at Real Madrid," added Modric at the Marca ceremony. The 36-year-old midfielder has been pivotal in Real Madrid's season, leading the team to clinch the La Liga title and reaching the Champions League final against Liverpool.
