The Indian government has announced some relaxations to its order on restricting wheat exports. It has been decided that wheat consignments that have been handed over to customs for examination and have been registered into their systems on or prior to May 13 would be allowed to be exported. The government also allowed a wheat consignment headed for Egypt, which was already loading at the Kandla port.
