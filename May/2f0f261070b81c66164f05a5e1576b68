For the first time since the pandemic, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C. is in full bloom, with the doors opening at unconventional hours. "Flowers After Hours" is an ode to "all things floral" featuring Korean American botanical artist Emily Paluska, who recreates one of the gallery's paintings with handmade paper flowers.
