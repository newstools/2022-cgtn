The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday urged the U.S. to fulfill its commitment to not support "Taiwan independence" with real actions, warning that reneging on the commitment will bring cost to the U.S. itself. U.S. Navy Admiral Michael Gilday on Tuesday said that China's Taiwan region "must gird itself against potential Chinese aggression through military deterrence that includes acquiring the right weapons and proper training." In response to his claim, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin pointed out the U.S. admits that Taiwan is part of China, but keeps talking about the mainland's potential "aggression" toward Taiwan. Such contradictory acts raise questions about the seriousness and validity of the relevant U.S. commitments, Wang added. The spokesperson called on the U.S. side to fulfill its related commitment to avoid undermining China-U.S. relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits.
