The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Navy said on Tuesday that the Liaoning aircraft carrier formation recently conducted a far sea combat training in the western Pacific Ocean. Gao Xiucheng, a PLA Navy spokesperson, said the training was in line with relevant international laws and practice and did not target anyone. “This is a routine training organized by the Navy in accordance with its annual work plan to improve its ability to carry out its mission,” he said.
