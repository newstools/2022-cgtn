The central Ukrainian city of Dnipro is just a few hundred kilometers from the most intense battle-zones in the conflict, including Kharkiv, Kherson and the Donbas region. Many ordinary people, who have been internally displaced by the fighting, have ended up in this city, looking to make a living as best as they can.
