Germany will make 10 billion euros ($10.5 billion) available for bilateral cooperation with India in the coming years, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced on Monday after talking with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Berlin. In a statement to the media, Scholz highlighted the countries' common aims, such as fighting climate change, and the importance of cooperation between democracies. Talking about the crisis in Ukraine, Scholz called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the conflict. "We believe that there will be no winner in this war, everyone will lose. We are in favour of peace," said Modi, whose visit to Europe will also take him to Denmark and France. This is Modi's first meeting with Scholz as German Chancellor, who assumed office in December 2021. During the visit, the two leaders will co-chair the 6th India-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations (IGC). Launched in 2011, the prime minister's departure statement said the IGC is a unique biennial mechanism which allows the two governments to coordinate on a wide spectrum of bilateral issues. Many ministers from both sides will participate in the IGC.
