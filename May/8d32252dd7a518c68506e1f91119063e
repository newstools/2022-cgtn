China's Long March-5B Y3 carrier rocket, which will launch lab module Wentian to the country's space station, arrived on Sunday at the launch site in the southern island province of Hainan. The rocket, along with the Wentian lab module which was already transported to Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site, will be assembled and tested at the launch site, announced the China Manned Space Agency. All the systems involved in the mission at the launch site are undergoing orderly preparations, said the agency. The Wentian lab module is scheduled to launch and dock with the Tianhe core module in July, and the Mengtian lab module will be docked with the core module in October to complete the in-orbit construction of the space station. Ultimately, a T-shaped complex will be formed once the construction of the space station is completed. (With input from Xinhua)
