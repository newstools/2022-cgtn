China's position on the issue of the visit by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is consistent, the Chinese Foreign Ministry stressed on Wednesday, saying China welcomes people from all over the world to visit Xinjiang to experience and understand the real situation in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks in response to the U.S. State Department's claim over UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet's visit to China. The U.S. side called Bachelet's visit a mistake, saying the U.S. has "no expectation that the PRC (People's Republic of China) will grant the necessary access required to conduct a complete, unmanipulated assessment of the human rights environment in Xinjiang." Wang pointed out the U.S. is shifting its position on the issue as the U.S. was the one who demanded the UN High Commissioner to visit Xinjiang at first but now it is the U.S. again that shouted loudly to oppose the High Commissioner's visit. The spokesperson also reiterated China opposes any investigation with the presumption of guilt. Wang noted the U.S. is afraid that its fabricated lies about so-called "genocide" and "forced labor" in Xinjiang will be detected by the international community, so it has to fabricate more lies to smear the Chinese side to mislead the international community. Even if the U.S. spreads more lies, the fact that Xinjiang now enjoys social stability and prosperity and the local people are living a safe and happy life will not be covered, Wang said, adding the U.S. move will only expose its attempt to politicize human rights issues and use them as tools.
