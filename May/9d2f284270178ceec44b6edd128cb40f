Twitter has agreed to pay $150 million to settle allegations it misused private information, such as telephone numbers, to target advertising at users after telling them the information would be used for security reasons, according to court documents filed on Wednesday. Twitter's settlement covers allegations that it misrepresented the "security and privacy" of user data between May 2013 and September 2019, according to the court documents. Twitter will pay $150 million as part of the settlement announced by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). In addition to the monetary settlement, the agreement requires Twitter to improve its compliance practices.
