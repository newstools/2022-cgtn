Bayern Munich celebrated their 10th successive German Bundesliga title triumph in front of their fans at Munich town hall on Sunday. It was the first time the squad had been able to mark a title win in such fashion in two years as last year's celebration was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. "As a little child I also once stood down there in the crowd," said Bayern Munich coach Julian Nagelsmann. "Then other players stood up here and I cheered them on. I hoped then that I also, one day, would stand up here as a world star, even if (I wished it) as a player. Now I am standing up here as a coach and also a dream comes true." Among the players at Sunday's ceremony was Robert Lewandowski, who may have been attending for a final time. "Two years ago we unfortunately couldn't be here. We have missed that to be here with you. But we can still have that in our heads. Also the 10th German Championship, that's quite something special and legendary. And all that we achieve we do together with you," said Lewandowski. Bayern Sporting Director Hasan Salihamidzic confirmed on Saturday that the Polish striker wants to leave the Bavarian club. Lewandowski, who has been linked with a move to Barcelona, has a contract with Bayern to 2023 but Salihamidzic said he turned down the club's offer to extend it and said "he would like to do something else."
