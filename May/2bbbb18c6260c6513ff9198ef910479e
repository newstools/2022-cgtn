U.S. Congress held its first hearing in half a century on May 17 on unidentified flying objects (UFO). And no, there is still no government confirmation of extraterrestrial life. Pentagon officials did not disclose additional information from their ongoing investigation of hundreds of unexplained sightings in the sky. Lawmakers at the hearing said any unexplained aerial phenomenon might be a threat to national security. And a defense official said the Pentagon was also trying to destigmatize the issue and encourage pilots and other military personnel to report anything unusual they see.
