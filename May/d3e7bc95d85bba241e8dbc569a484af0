Former U.S. President Donald Trump, speaking at the annual convention of the National Rifle Association (NRA) on Friday, made a fierce defense of weapons just three days after a shooting that killed 19 children and two teachers at a school in Uvalde, Texas. He argued the United States should make it easier to confine "deranged" people and eliminate gun-free school zones. He also questioned how the U.S. "has $40 billion to send to Ukraine" but cannot ensure security in schools.
