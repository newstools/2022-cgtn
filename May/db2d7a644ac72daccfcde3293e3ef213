South Korea says the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has fired a short-range ballistic missile into the sea. Seoul and Tokyo added it was likely a submarine-launched ballistic missile. This would be the DPRK's second missile launch in three days, and its 15th major weapons test this year.
