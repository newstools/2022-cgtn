German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has faced protests against supplying heavy arms to Ukraine. He spoke at a May Day rally of unions in Duesseldorf defending German arms deliveries. Protesters argued that could provoke a Russian military response and spark a broader conflict. More than 123,000 people have signed a petition urging Olaf Scholz to refrain from sending heavy weaponry to Ukraine.
