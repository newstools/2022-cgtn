China's first hybrid energy power station utilizing solar and tidal power to generate electricity became fully operational on Monday in Wenling City of east China's Zhejiang Province. The project marks the country's latest approach toward harnessing two green energy sources in a complementary manner for power generation. With an installed capacity of 100 megawatts, the power plant ensures more stability for the utilization of renewable energy. Since solar energy supply is intermittent and unavailable when the sun goes down, tidal waves could replace it by supplying power during the night. Moon's gravity causes tides in the oceans. "The project has created a new model of comprehensive utilization of new energy by coordinating tidal and photovoltaic power generation using both sunlight and water [tides]," Feng Shuchen, executive vice president of the China Energy Group, told China Media Group (CMG). "It has also effectively promoted innovation and development to accelerate structural energy reform and industrial upgrading." The power plant has been built on over 133 hectares with 185,000 installed photovoltaic modules. Its annual output will be over 100 million kWh to meet the annual electricity demand of about 30,000 urban households. Compared with the same-size thermal power plant, the hybrid energy power station will save around 28,716 tonnes of standard coal and reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 76,638 tonnes annually.
