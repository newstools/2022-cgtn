Juventus captain Giorgio Chiellini and forward Paolo Dybala said goodbye to the Old Lady fans during a 2-2 draw with Lazio at Allianz Stadium in the Italian Serie A on Monday. Juventus substituted Chiellini off the pitch in the 17th minute for a symbolic departure that represented his 17 years spent with the club. Italian center-back took off the captain's armband and gave it to Dybala. Chiellini, 37, then went along the stands to shake hands with fans who said goodbye to their captain, who helped Juve win 20 major honors across his career, including nine Scudetto titles and five Coppa Italia trophies. In the match, Alvaro Morata set up Dusan Vlahovic, who scored the opener, then the Spanish forward got on the scoresheet himself. Lazio pulled one back after the break with an own goal from Alex Sandro. With the hosts holding on to their lead, Juve coach Massimiliano Allegri took Dybala off with 12 minutes left and the Argentinian forward was also given a warm ovation before he too leaves the Turin club on a free transfer. Sergej Milinkovic-Savic scored a last-gasp equalizer for Lazio to secure a Europa League spot for Maurizio Sarri's team. "It was a marvelous evening full of emotions. It was a night for Dybala and Chiellini," Allegri said after the match. "Chiellini is quitting. He gave Italian, European and world football so much in terms of passion and love for his job," the coach added. "Dybala was an important player for seven years at Juventus. He earned his place and the fans quite rightly gave him an extraordinary tribute that he deserved."
