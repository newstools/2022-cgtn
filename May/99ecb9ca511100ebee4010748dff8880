The International Basketball Federation (FIBA) on Wednesday excluded Russia and Belarus from participating in and hosting international tournaments until further notice. The men's teams of Russia and Belarus have been withdrawn from European qualifiers for the World Cup next year and are not being replaced. Russia's women's team, who were due to play in the World Cup in Australia this year, have been withdrawn and replaced by Puerto Rico, while the Under-17 women's team of Russia have been replaced with Serbia for the World Cup in Hungary. Neither country is allowed to participate in 3X3 competitions this year, including the World Cup. Several sports federations have banned Russian and Belarusian athletes and officials, and moved or cancelled events in the countries. Earlier, the Football Union of Russia withdrew its appeal against FIFA's decision to kick its men's football national team out of the 2022 World Cup. But Russia will continue to fight suspensions from other sporting competitions, including gymnastics, rugby, rowing and skating, according to reports. (With input from agencies)
