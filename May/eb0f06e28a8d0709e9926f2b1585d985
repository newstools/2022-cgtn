The transitional government of Mali announced on Monday it was breaking off from its defense accords with France, citing multiple instances of French forces having violated the country’s airspace. “For some time now, the government of the Republic of Mali notes with regret a profound deterioration in military cooperation with France,” the transitional government spokesperson Abdoulaye Maiga said in a televised statement. France is yet to respond. (With input from AFP)
