Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, the speaker of Pakistan's National Assembly or the lower house of the country's parliament on Sunday paid a visit to the Chinese Embassy in Pakistan to offer his condolences regarding the recent attack on Chinese teachers. He's the latest senior Pakistani official to pay his condolences after others, including President Arif Alvi. Ashraf said the Pakistani Parliament strongly condemned this inhumane act of terrorism and promised to apprehend the perpetrators and strengthen security protection of Chinese nationals on Pakistan's soil. On April 26, a terror attack on a van at the Confucius Institute at the University of Karachi killed three Chinese teachers and injured a fourth one.
