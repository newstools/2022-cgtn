China's producer price index (PPI) slowed down from the previous month, despite the surge in global commodity prices, according to official data from the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS). The country's PPI increased by 8.0 percent year on year in April, down 0.3 percentage points from the previous month, faster than the 7.7-percent growth tipped by a Reuters Poll, leaving more room for stimulus for the economy, which faces downward pressure from stringent COVID-19 curbs, and a slowdown in export and domestic consumption. The slower rise in the PPI was driven by government measures to stabilize commodity prices and increase supply, said Dong Lijuan, a senior statistician with the NBS. China's consumer price index (CPI) rose by 2.1 percent year on year in April, speeding up from March's 1.5-percent growth and beating expectations for a 1.8-percent rise in the Reuters Poll. Dong said that the rise in the CPI was mainly caused by higher logistics costs during the country's COVID-19 resurgence, measures to fight the virus and stockpiling by consumers.
