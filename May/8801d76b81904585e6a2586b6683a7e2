The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday that almost 15 million deaths globally were directly or indirectly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic by the end of 2021. It said the full COVID-19 death toll, or "excess mortality," was approximately 14.9 million between January 1, 2020, and December 31, 2021. This figure is calculated as the difference between the number of deaths that have occurred and the number that would be expected in the absence of the pandemic based on data from earlier years. According to the WHO, most of the excess deaths – 84 percent – were concentrated in Southeast Asia, Europe and the Americas, and some 68 percent in just 10 countries globally. Meanwhile, middle-income countries accounted for 81 percent of the 14.9 million excess deaths, while high- and low-income countries 15 and 4 percent, respectively. The global death toll was higher for men, with 57 percent, than for women, 43 percent, and higher among older adults. The "indirect deaths," according to the UN agency, were attributable to other health conditions for which people were unable to access prevention and treatment, because health systems were overburdened by the pandemic.
