Regional economic cooperation initiatives should be open and inclusive, instead of discriminatory and exclusive, China's Ministry of Commerce said on Tuesday, reacting to the launch of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) by U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday. "(Such initiatives) should promote economic cooperation and solidarity, not undermine and divide existing mechanisms," the ministry said on its website, adding that China has always been open to regional economic cooperation initiatives that meet the above criteria.
