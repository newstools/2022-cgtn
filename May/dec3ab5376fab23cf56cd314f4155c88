A legal conference on the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administration Region (HKSAR) was held on Friday, one of the celebratory events for the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China. Organized by the Department of Justice of the HKSAR government, the conference, themed "Stability to Prosperity," brought together prominent and heavyweight speakers from different sectors to discuss how the central government can consolidate the constitutional order of the HKSAR and bring Hong Kong's democratic development back on track, the interpretation and practice of the Basic Law, as well as how to boost Hong Kong's economy. Carrie Lam, chief executive of the HKSAR, said in her speech that Hong Kong is an inseparable part of China, and "One Country" is undoubtedly the backbone as well as a major prerequisite for the sustainable development of "Two Systems." She said she firmly believes that only by acting in accordance with the Constitution and the Basic Law, relying on the central government and safeguarding national security can Hong Kong's prosperity and stability be ensured. Over the past 25 years, the practice of "One Country, Two Systems" has been a universally recognized success, said Wang Linggui, deputy director of the State Council Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office. The next five years will be crucial for Hong Kong as it has transited from chaos to order and is advancing to prosperity, Wang said, adding that Hong Kong should stay firmly committed to the right path of "One Country, Two Systems" and ensure the full and accurate implementation of the Basic Law. Chen Dong, deputy director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the HKSAR, said that in the past 25 years since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the implementation of the Basic Law has safeguarded China's sovereignty, security, and development interests and the central government's overall governance over the region. As long as Hong Kong sticks to the fundamental principle of "One Country," makes good use of the advantages of "Two Systems" and becomes better integrated into the overall development of the country, it will be able to effectively cope with various risks and challenges and continue to write a new chapter in the practice of "One Country, Two Systems," Chen said.
