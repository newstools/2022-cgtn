AC Milan won their first Serie A title in 11 years on Sunday after beating Sassuolo 3-0 in Reggio Emilia to snatch the crown from local rivals Inter Milan. Needing just a point to claim the Scudetto, Milan swept their hosts aside thanks to an Olivier Giroud brace and another goal from Franck Kessie in the first half in front of an army of away fans at the Mapei Stadium. Exciting winger Rafael Leao contributed a hat-trick of assists with the Brazilian coming of age this season and is reportedly a summer target for various powerhouses in Europe. Stefano Pioli's Milan finished two points ahead of defending champions Inter, who beat Sampdoria 3-0 at home. Fans partied in Milan and poured onto the pitch in Reggio Emilia as the 'Rossoneri' returned to the top of the Italian game after years of poor teams and financial problems since their last league crown in 2011. Milan were imperious in winning their sixth match on the bounce and securing a title which for long tracts of the season looked like Inter's to lose. (With input from AFP)
