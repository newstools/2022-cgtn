Each spring, in the sea near Dalian City in Liaodong Bay, a small isle called Xingrentuo is full of hustle and bustle. In March, the spring breeze accompanies the returning birds from their wintering ground. Hundreds of birds set up homes, making the rocky isle the hottest real estate. World Migratory Bird Day is officially celebrated on the second Saturday of May in Canada and the United States. Coincidentally, it falls on May 14 this year, and it would be a nice time to join an avian party with these birds.
