Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday encouraged a group of young scholars returning from overseas studies to contribute to China's efforts to advance self-reliance in science and technology. In a letter replying to the Nanjing University-based young scholars, Xi also called on them to contribute to enhancing cultural confidence and realizing the Chinese Dream of national rejuvenation. The 120 young scholars who joined Nanjing University after studies abroad wrote to Xi about their teaching and research. They expressed determination to follow the path of generations of scientists and contribute to the country's development. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the founding of Nanjing University. Large numbers of scholars returning to China after overseas studies have pursued careers at the university over the years, including geologist Li Siguang (1889-1971) and nuclear physicist Cheng Kaijia (1918-2018). Xi hailed the young scholars' remarks and extended congratulations and greetings to university staff, students and alumni on the anniversary. China has vowed to enhance sci-tech self-reliance and achieve breakthroughs in core technologies, according to its latest development blueprint.
