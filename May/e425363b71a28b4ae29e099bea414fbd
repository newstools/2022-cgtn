Stephen Curry and the Golden State Warriors are standing behind their head coach Steve Kerr, who called for gun reform in the wake of a shooting at a Texas school on Tuesday. At least 19 children and two adults were killed after an 18-year-old opened fire in the elementary school in Ulvade. "I got kids, send them to school every day, drop them off. And you feel for the parents that are going through what they're going through," Curry told reporters after the Warriors' Game 4 loss to the Dallas Mavericks in the Western Conference Finals. "I can't even imagine the pain. So for coach (Steve Kerr) to come up here and say what he said and every word that he said was powerful, was meaningful." "Just talked basketball. You know, we did have sort of an unspoken awareness of, you know, what happened today," Kerr said in the post-game press conference, describing the atmosphere among his players ahead of Game 4. "It was a very quiet locker room beforehand. You know, I felt like as a coach, my job is get the team ready to play. Difficult to sort of keep perspective on a day like today. But that's, you know, that's the shock and the grief, the anger that's there from all of our guys and from, I'm sure, everybody in the building. So you just you have to accept that and go out and play."
