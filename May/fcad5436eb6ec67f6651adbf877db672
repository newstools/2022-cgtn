The two-day conference concluded on Thursday in Beijing. China's complaint handling system, or xinfang, which means complaint letters and visits, dates back to the early 1950s and has played a supporting role in public supervision over Party and state organs. The term "complaint letters and visits" refers to the mechanism through which a citizen, legal person or organization, by way of letter, e-mail, telephone or visit, etc., reports facts, submits proposals or opinions, or files a complaint to the people's governments at various levels to be dealt with by the relevant administrative organs according to law. In April, the CPC Central Committee and the State Council issued a regulation for handling public complaint letters and visits, pledging to improve the quality and efficiency of the process.The regulation highlighted the significance of work related to handling public complaints, saying that public complaints provide an important window through which an understanding of society and the people's opinions can be obtained.
