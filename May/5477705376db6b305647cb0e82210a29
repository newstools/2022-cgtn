FIFA President Gianni Infantino said on Monday at the World Economic Forum that world football's governing body has used compensation received from corruption probes to re-invest in the sport and "regain trust" in the organization. The U.S. Department of Justice confirmed last year that FIFA would receive $201 million in compensation for losses sustained in global soccer corruption schemes. Infantino revealed that FIFA has "put their house in order" and used that money to help grow the game, following the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The 52-year-old also said the World Cup in Qatar later this year will be "the best World Cup ever," despite criticisms over human rights issues in the country and the staging of the prestigious tournament during November and December. "This is a special year. We come out of the pandemic. We are in a divided world. We need excuses to bring people together. We have the best excuse with the World Cup. Come to Qatar from the 21st of November to the 18th of December. You will have the experience of your life, the best World Cup ever. Not only from a football point of view, but also from an experience point of view – witnessing the Arab culture, the history, the welcoming way of dealing with those who will come. And this will certainly contribute to ... well, maybe a little bit to making the world feel a little bit better," he said. (With input from AP)
