U.S. President Joe Biden's public approval rating fell to 36% this week, the lowest level of his presidency, according to a Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll completed on Tuesday, as Americans suffer from rising inflation. The two-day national poll found that 59% of Americans disapprove of Biden's job performance. His overall approval was down six percentage points from 42% last week.
