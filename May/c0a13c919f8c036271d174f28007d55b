On a night of wild swings in Serie A, Inter Milan came from two goals down on Friday to beat Empoli and later Juventus conceded two late goals to lose at Genoa. In Milan, Lautaro Martinez scored twice as Inter fought back to beat Empoli 4-2 and jump to the top of Serie A. "The team showed character. We're here," said Inter coach Simone Inzaghi on DAZN. In the late game, Juventus dominated relegation-haunted Genoa only to concede an 87th minute equalizer and a 96th minute penalty, converted by Domenico Criscito, who had missed a late derby penalty a week earlier. "Football gives and takes," said Criscito. Inter moved one point ahead of rivals AC Milan and have a superior goal difference but have played a game more. Juventus started the evening mathematically still in the title race. They ended it still in fourth, a point behind Napoli, and nine points behind Inter with two games left.
