The bodies of 14 people have been found washed up on a beach in Myanmar, an official told AFP on Monday, with a local rescue group saying some were Rohingya attempting to reach Malaysia. "Fourteen dead bodies were found, 35 people including the boat owners were rescued alive," said Lieutenant Colonel Tun Shwe, a police spokesperson in Pathein district, around 200 kilometres west of Yangon.
