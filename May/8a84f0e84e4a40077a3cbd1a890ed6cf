As Shanghai enters another phase of its reopening, work has resumed for most factories. The two-month COVID-19 quarantine has crippled businesses across the city, but some companies said they are still confident as Shanghai gradually recovers. North American wellness company Melaleuca is wasting no time getting back to work, after half a month of suspension. "Our 116 employees stayed in the factory for 44 straight days since April 14. Thanks to their efforts, our production capacity is back up to 50 percent. We expect full capacity by mid-June," said Yu Yi, director of Fengxian Manufacturing at Melaleuca China. The latest COVID-19 outbreak brought Shanghai to an unprecedented standstill. Even as it reopens, companies have to face logistics delays, labor shortages and certifications for work resumption. "During this outbreak, Melaleuca's headquarters in the U.S. were very concerned about operations in China and gave us a lot of support. This factory is Melaleuca's largest overseas headquarters and daily chemical production base, with an investment of $150 million. This is proof of Melaleuca's confidence in the Chinese market," said Yu. Despite COVID-19 outbreaks staggering business operations for many and causing struggles with economic recovery, both domestic and international enterprises remain hopeful that the Chinese market will bounce back. Hitachi Elevator is among the top 500 foreign-invested enterprises in China. In 2007, it set up manufacturing bases in Shanghai. The general manager said they'll make up for losses in March and April, and Hitachi aims to ship over 2,600 elevators by the end of May. "Although some of our orders were lost last month, we've still kept some major ones. Now, customers know we have resumed work and production in Shanghai, and they've expressed their expectations and confidence in us," said Jiang Yijian, general manager of Hitachi Elevator (Shanghai) Co.
