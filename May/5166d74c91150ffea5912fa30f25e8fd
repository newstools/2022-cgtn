Real Madrid beat Liverpool 1-0 in the Champions League final in Paris on Saturday for a record-extending 14th time, after a night marred by problems outside the ground that led to the kick-off being delayed by over half an hour. Brazil winger Vinicius Junior was the match-winner, applying a close-range finish in the 59th minute from Federico Valverde's drive across the face of goal, while goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois took just as many plaudits by making breathtaking saves from Sadio Mane and Mohamed Salah. "Today nobody was going to get in my way," Courtois said. "I was going to win a Champions League no matter what." In a battle of European heavyweights, Juergen Klopp's side had more opportunities but lacked sharpness when it mattered as Carlo Ancelotti became the first coach to enjoy double Champions League success with two clubs having triumphed with AC Milan. The victory gave Ancelotti a fourth European Cup title, the most ever for a manager in the competition's history, and completed the Champions League-La Liga double for a Spanish giant for whom winning titles is ingrained in its culture. "We are the best," Madrid striker Karim Benzema said. "It was a very difficult competition for us and we deserved to win this final. With all the history this team has, we showed everyone that we are always here." A week ago, Liverpool were in contention for an unprecedented quadruple of major trophies, but ended with just the two domestic cups in England, and lost out on the Premier League title by one point last weekend and the Champions League to a Madrid team that had one shot on target in the final. Liverpool failed to score a single goal in their three cup finals this season. The Reds won the FA Cup and League Cup via penalty shootouts after 0-0 draws after extra time. (With input from agencies)
