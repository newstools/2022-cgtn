At least eight children were killed on Saturday when a three-wheeled vehicle overturned and sank into an irrigation canal in Beheira Province in Egypt's Nile Delta, the federal public prosecutor said in a statement. The 19-year-old driver has been detained and interrogated on charges of involuntary manslaughter and driving an improperly-maintained and unlicensed vehicle. (With input from Xinhua)
