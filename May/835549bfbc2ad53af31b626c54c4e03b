Zheng Qinwen of China beat Alize Cornet of France 2-0 (6-0, 3-0) in the women's singles tennis third-round match at the French Open at Roland Garros in Paris on Saturday to reach the Round of 16 of the competition. Zheng didn't allow even one game to go away from her as she dominated the court with five break points to win the first set 6-0 and lead 3-0 in the second set until Cornet decided to retire because of injury. Zheng entered good form from the beginning of Saturday's match. Her patience and ability to control the course of returning helped her build an early lead of 3-0 in the first set after achieving two breaks. As the match went on, Zheng grew even better exploiting her advantage in serving, which was not the fastest, but very powerful thanks to her 1.8-meter height. Having won the first set with a sweeping 6-0, she was already in the zone. Zheng's performance soon shut down Court Philippe-Chatrier, which gave Jelena Ostapenko of Latvia a noisy, hard time by voicing support in her loss against home player Cornet. Zheng only began to participate in WTA Tours from 2021, but her growth has been faster than many expected. Before Saturday's victory over Cornet, she already beat former world No. 1 Simona Halep of Romania in an epic comeback win in the second round. With every match she wins, Zheng has been setting records of how far she goes at the French Open, which is the second Grand Slam she has competed in her career. Back in January, she reached the second round at the Australian Open. Zheng's opponent in the Round of 16 match will be reigning world No. 1 Iga Swiatek of Poland. Swiatek has already claimed 30 straight wins after beating Alison Riske on Thursday and had won the French Open title in 2020.
