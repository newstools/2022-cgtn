Beijing reported 50 new local COVID-19 infections from 3:00 p.m. Sunday to 3:00 p.m. Monday, including 41 confirmed cases and nine asymptomatic, said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention, at a press briefing on Monday. Pang said the spread of recent COVID-19 infections since April 22 is mostly due to group dining, lack of vaccination, and activities in multiple locations. Beijing also announced to carry out another three rounds of COVID-19 testing in its 12 districts to get ahead of the virus spread. Three districts in Beijing have been upgraded from medium-risk areas to high-risk areas. The city currently has 10 high-risk areas and 26 medium-risk areas in total.
