The total value of China's imports and exports rose by 7.9 percent year on year in the first four months of 2022 despite growing headwinds in foreign trade, official data showed on Monday. Foreign trade value reached 12.58 trillion yuan ($1.88 trillion) during the period, with exports jumping 10.3 percent from the same period last year to 6.97 trillion yuan and imports growing by 5 percent to 5.61 trillion yuan, according to the General Administration of Customs (GAC). China's goal of maintaining stability and improving foreign trade throughout the year is still well supported, GAC spokesperson Li Kuiwen said. Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) remains China's largest trading partner, making up 14.6 percent of China's total foreign trade. China's imports and exports to ASEAN, the European Union and the United States were 1.84 trillion yuan, 1.73 trillion yuan and 1.56 trillion yuan, up 7.2 percent, 6.8 percent and 8.7 percent year on year, respectively. During the same period, the total imports and exports between China and the countries along the Belt and Road increased by 15.4 percent, while trade with the other 14 member countries of Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership raised by 3.9 percent. The Chinese government announced new measures last week to help foreign trade enterprises cope with challenges. While chairing a State Council executive meeting, Premier Li Keqiang placed emphasis on securing orders and stabilizing imports and exports in key labor-intensive industries.
