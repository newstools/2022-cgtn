China on Thursday urged the United States to stop using Tibet-related issues to interfere in China's internal affairs. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian made the remarks in response to a question about so-called U.S. special coordinator for Tibet issues, Uzra Zeya, also the U.S. under secretary of state, on Wednesday meeting the head and representative of the "Tibetan government-in-exile" in India. The so-called "Tibetan government-in-exile" is an out-and-out separatist political group and an illegal organization completely in violation of China's Constitution and laws, Zhao noted, adding "It is not recognized by any country in the world." He said the 14th Dalai Lama is not a purely religious figure, but a political exile who has long been engaged in separatist activities and attempted to split Tibet from China. The spokesperson also pointed out the establishment of the "Special Coordinator for Tibet Issues" by the U.S. is an interference in China's internal affairs. Tibet affairs are purely internal affairs of China, and brook no interference by any external forces, Zhao stressed, calling on the U.S. side to take concrete actions to honor its commitment to recognize Tibet as a part of China and not support "Tibetan independence." China will continue to take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty, security, and development interests, he added.
