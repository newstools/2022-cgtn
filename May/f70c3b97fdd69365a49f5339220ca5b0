The Beijing legs of the International Skating Union (ISU) Short Track Speed Skating World Cup series scheduled for December have been canceled, according to the Chinese Skating Association on Friday. The 2022 season of the Short Track World Cup series will begin in Montreal, Canada, on October 28. The back-to-back competitions in the Chinese capital were scheduled as the third and fourth legs, which other cities can now bid to host. Meanwhile, it is also uncertain where the fifth leg, which falls between February 3 and 5 next year, will take place, according to the ISU. Team China clinched their first gold medal at the Beijing Winter Olympics in the short track mixed relay event in February, featuring World Cup champions Wu Dajing, Ren Ziwei, and others.
