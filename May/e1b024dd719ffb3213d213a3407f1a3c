U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday rolled out the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework (IPEF) during his visit to Japan. However, the IPEF is neither complete nor clear and fails to offer practical benefits such as tariff cuts and market access to related countries at the micro-level. On top of that, it is difficult for the Biden administration to provide sufficient political and economic capital for the framework, while it faces rising inflationary pressures. Biden’s only purpose is to exclude China. In this episode of #BizBeat, CGTN's Michelle Van den Bergh explains why she thinks the U.S. IPEF will be doomed to fail.
