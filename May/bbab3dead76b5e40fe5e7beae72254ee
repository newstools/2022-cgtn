Canelo Alvarez and Dmitry Bivol made weight on Friday, a day ahead of their WBA light heavy-weight title fight in Las Vegas. Alvarez weighed 174.4 pounds to Bivol's 174.6. The Mexican superstar Alvarez (57-1-2 39 KOs) last fought in November against Caleb Plant, winning by TKO to become the undisputed super middle-weight champion. He chose to move back to 175 to start a run at becoming undisputed in another weight class. The titleholder Bivol (19-0 11 KOs) last defended his belt in December, beating Umar Salamov by unanimous decision in his home nation of Russia. For the first time in three years, Alvarez is set to compete in Las Vegas on Cinco de Mayo Weekend, the date and site typically reserved for boxing's top star. The Mexican will attempt to become a two-time light heavy-weight champion following a November 2019 KO victory over Sergey Kovalev at 175 pounds. After that bout, Alvarez vacated his light heavyweight title to campaign at 168 pounds.
