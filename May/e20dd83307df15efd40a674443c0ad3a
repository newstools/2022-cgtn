Every May 5 marks the World Hand Hygiene Day. Led by the World Health Organization (WHO), this year's theme focuses on recognizing that we can add to a facility's climate or culture of safety and quality through cleaning our hands but also that a strong quality and safety culture will encourage people to clean hands at the right times and with the right products.
