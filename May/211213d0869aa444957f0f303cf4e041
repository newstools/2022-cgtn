European Parliament Member Clare Daly was interviewed by China Media Group on the sidelines of its plenary session in Strasbourg on Tuesday. Daly said the U.S. benefits the most from the Ukraine crisis, for which Europe will pay a heavy price, and that the main reason the conflict is still ongoing is because "the U.S. does not want peace. They want the war to continue in order to weaken Russia."
