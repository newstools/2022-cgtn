Against the backdrop of COVID-19, natural disasters and the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the prices of daily necessities, petrol prices and transportation in Australia continue to rise. As Reuters reported on April 27, "Australian consumer prices surged at the fastest annual pace in two decades last quarter as petrol, home building and food costs all climbed." CGTN Stringer went to supermarkets and petrol stations in Melbourne to find out what lies behind the rising prices. "There is growing concern for lower-income Australians that they aren't getting wage rises. With continuing rising prices in Australia, the future seems very unpredictable indeed," the stringer said.
