Anastasia is a Russian poet and translator who has been living in China for almost 10 years. Her residential compound in Shanghai has been locked down during the recent COVID-19 outbreak, and she has shared some of her life in quarantine through a vlog. In her videos, she expresses her opinions toward the recent negative emotions amid the pandemic and reads poetry she has written. Anastasia hopes everyone can find peace and engage in hobbies during this tough time, and perhaps use poetry as a bridge of communication and as a path to more positive emotions.
