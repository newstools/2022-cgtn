Hotan Prefecture is located south of the Tianshan Mountains in the southern part of China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. The security situation has been critical in the area since the discovery of illegal weapons from abroad on April 6, 1998. From 2011 to 2016, Hotan has been hit by multiple violent attacks by separatist, extremist and terrorist forces. In counter-attacks, many brave souls have given their lives to ensure the safety and prosperity of the region. Take a look at how the law enforcement personnel thwart the activities and nefarious designs of the terrorists.
