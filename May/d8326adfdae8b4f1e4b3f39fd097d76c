The U.S. has imposed new sanctions on individuals and entities linked to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). The sanctions are a retaliation against Pyongyang's recent missile launches. Two Russian banks are included on the sanction list, which the U.S. Treasury Department accused of providing financial services to the DPRK. The department said the U.S. would continue to implement sanctions, while urging the DPRK to abandon its pursuit of weapons of mass destruction. The DPRK has held more than a dozen ballistic missile tests this year.
