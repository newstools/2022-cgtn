Spectators will be allowed at the 2022 Chinese Super League (CSL)'s opening match, which will see newly promoted Zhejiang FC challenge defending champions Shandong Taishan in south China's Haikou City on June 3. Two other host cities, Meizhou in south China's Guangzhou Province and Dalian in northern Liaoning Province, will not have spectators in the first phase. Meanwhile, Dalian Pro FC, who were relegated last season, will replace the recently disbanded Chongqing Liangjiang Athletic this season, as this year marks the first season since the CSL's expansion to 18 clubs. Eighteen clubs will play 10 rounds in the first phase from June 3 to July 12. During the 40-day span, a total of 90 matches will be played. In addition, Shanghai Jiading Longhui club will be promoted to the second-tier China League One, filling in the vacancy left by Dalian, while China's men's U-19 national team will not participate in the third-division China League Two, with that division downsized from 20 to 18 teams. According to the Chinese Football Association, the temporary transfer window for CSL clubs started on May 27 and will close on June 10, while second- and third-division clubs will have a longer window running until June 15. Each club can introduce and register no more than three former Chongqing players. (With input from Xinhua)
