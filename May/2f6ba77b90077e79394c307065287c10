A man disguised as an old woman threw a cake at the Mona Lisa painting in the Louvre Museum in Paris, Spanish newspaper Marca reported. The 500-year-old painting by Leonardo da Vinci was protected by safety glass. Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci's half-length painting is regarded as one of the world's most famous paintings. The painting was unaffected by the cake, which remained smeared on the protective glass encasing the artwork.
