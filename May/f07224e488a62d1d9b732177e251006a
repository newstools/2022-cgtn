A special train carrying more than 500 migrant workers has left Suihua Railway Station in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province for the rice fields of the Sanjiang Plain. Migrant workers go there every year as there are not enough local farmhands to clear the fields and transplant rice seedlings. These special trains have transported over 1.8 million migrant workers to and from the Sanjiang Plain.
