Manchester City showcased their latest triumph – the English Premier League title – in a victory parade, which took place through the streets of the city center on Monday. City dramatically won the Premier League on the last day of the season, as they fought back from two goals down to defeat Aston Villa 3-2 at the Etihad Stadium, which saw them finish just one point ahead of title rivals Liverpool on Sunday. It marked a fourth Premier League title in five seasons for Pep Guardiola's side, who finished the 2021-22 campaign with a goal difference of +73, as they scored 99 goals and conceded only 26. City's winning tally of 93 points was the joint fourth-highest total in Premier League history – yet, remarkably, it is only the third-highest tally the club have attained during Guardiola's six-year reign.
