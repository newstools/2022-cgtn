Chinese Premier Li Keqiang called for more methods to stabilize the market and employment during a meeting in southwest China's Yunnan Province on Wednesday. Li said the government should see jobs as a priority and stabilize employment by keeping market participants running. He asked the government to fully implement current policies on tax deduction and refund, while guiding financial institutions to delay interest payments for middle and small enterprises and self-employed people. The government is also required to ensure the supply of food and energy, and improve transportation while controlling the pandemic. Li hosted the meeting as economic indicators in China started to go down in April, signaling a possible downturn. He noted that there are more than 150 million market players, and the price is stable, which provides room for policies to deal with the challenges. Li requested all departments in all areas to take every viable measure to keep economic indicators within a reasonable range and bring the economy back to normal.
