Three people were killed and three others wounded when a Saudi "spy drone" crashed in a populous Sanaa neighborhood on Monday, causing additional property damage, Houthi-run al-Masirah TV has reported, citing local health authorities. "With a surface-to-air missile, our air defense shot down the drone that was hovering over Sanaa in violation of the truce," Yehya Sarea, spokesperson for Yemen's Houthi militia said in an interview. Neither the coalition nor the Yemeni government has yet commented on the incident.
