In the Philippines, initial vote counting is almost complete, after the country held presidential elections on Monday. Protesters have gathered outside the election commission in the capital Manila against what they're calling an "unjust process". Their complaints involve faulty machines and long lines during the polls, and also the potential rule of presidential contender Ferdinand Marcos Junior. It's an apparent win for the former senator, with more than 30 million votes. The winner will take office on June 30 for a single six-year term.
