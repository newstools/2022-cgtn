China on Tuesday refuted the so-called concerns of the United States and Britain over UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet's visit to China. What truly worries these countries is that their attempt to use the so-called "Xinjiang issue" to contain China will fail miserably after the international community sees the real situation in Xinjiang, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said at a daily press briefing. Responding to an inquiry on U.S. State Department Spokesperson Ned Price's "concerns" over Bachelet's visit, Wang said that for some time, Western countries such as the United States and Britain have staged one political farce after another surrounding the high commissioner's visit to China. First, they publicly pressured the high commissioner to visit China to conduct a so-called "investigation" based on the presumption of guilt, Wang said. Then, after China and the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights decided on the visit through consultations on an equal footing, these countries jumped out again and spared no efforts to disrupt the visit, setting up various conditions and obstacles and trying to manipulate the visit. "Do they really care about human rights, or just want to politicize the human rights issue and use it as a weapon against China?" Wang asked. The spokesperson noted that these countries do not care about the truth at all, but try to use Bachelet's visit to hype up the so-called "Xinjiang issue" and smear China. "What they are really worried about is that when people from the international community, including the high commissioner, see the real situation in Xinjiang, their fabricated lies and rumors will be debunked and their attempt to contain China using the so-called 'Xinjiang issue' will go bankrupt," Wang said.
