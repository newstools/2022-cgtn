A team of sign language teachers in Beijing have been helping people with hearing impairment communicate and receive information since the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic. Communities in China usually inform the residents of nucleic acid testing arrangements through text messages and loudspeakers. The hearing-impaired, however, can receive the text messages only if they have cell phones. Their difficulties have been duly noted by the team of sign language teachers led by Xie Ying in the Shijingshan District of Beijing.
