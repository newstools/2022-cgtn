At least 22 militants of the extremist group Boko Haram have been killed by troops of the Multinational Joint Task Force on the fringes of Lake Chad. In a statement reported by Xinhua on Sunday, MNJTF spokesperson Kamarudeen Adegoke said their troops attacked Boko Haram strongholds in the vicinity of Tumbun Rago, a town in the restive northeastern Nigerian state of Borno. "Despite strong resistance by the Boko Haram terrorists, the ground troops charged through several obstacles and cleared the mined routes, which made them come in contact with elements of the insurgents," Adegoke said.
