The first day of the second solar term of the summer, "Xiaoman," or Lesser Fullness, falls on May 21, 2022. It is also the eighth of the 24 solar terms on lunar Chinese calendar. Lesser Fullness is linked to phenological phenomena. Explanations for "fullness" differ in southern and northern China. In the north, the term reflects the summer grains and crops that are plumping up but have not yet matured. In the south, however, it usually refers to the increasing flow in rivers and waterfalls, as the weather during this period of time is quite humid with frequent rainfall. Generally, Lesser Fullness is when temperature gaps between the north and the south narrow, and summer gradually becomes the most dominant season. The representative animal of Lesser Fullness is the silkworm. Ancient China saw the emergence of agricultural civilization, when silk production played a very important role. As silkworms, a producer of natural silk, were very difficult to raise, the Chinese considered this vital but delicate creature a gift from the silk deity. Therefore, to provide offerings and convey thanks to the deity, ancient Chinese would hold rituals on the first day of the Lesser Fullness and pray for a better harvest of silks for the year.
