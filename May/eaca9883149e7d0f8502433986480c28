Lyon won the Women's Champions League on Saturday after beating Barcelona 3-1 to be crowned queens of Europe for a record-extending eighth time. First half goals from Amandine Henry, Ada Hegerberg and Catarina Macario were enough to take the title from pre-match holders Barca, who pulled one back through captain Alexia Putellas just before half-time. Expectation was high among Barca fans, who descended in large numbers at the Allianz Stadium in Turin to watch their team which had been tipped to end Lyon's dominance of the women's game in Europe. However, they couldn't come back from going three goals down in the first 33 minutes. "I'm super happy to have scored because it helped us settle in to the match. It will remain engraved in my memory," said Henry after her blockbuster finish. "I'm not used to scoring but this will give me even more confidence and more desire to keep playing." The result also means that Lyon manager Sonia Bompastor has become the first woman to win the Champions League as a player and manager.
