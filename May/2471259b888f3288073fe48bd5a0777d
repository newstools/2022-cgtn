Xinjiang Daqo New Energy, one of the leading manufacturers of polysilicon in China, is among the five companies sanctioned by the U.S. last June over allegations of "forced labor". However, the company's records show that in July 2021, among its 2,069 employees, only 23 were from ethnic groups, accounting for about 1 percent of the total, and none of them were Uygur or Kazakh. CGTN visited the company to find out more.
