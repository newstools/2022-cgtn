Italian Camila Giorgi reached the French Open fourth round for the first time with a 4-6, 6-1, 6-0 win against No. 7 seed Belarusian Aryna Sabalenka. "I think it was a great game," Giorgi said after her win on Court Simonne Mathieu. "It was a very good match, and especially out there it's a new stadium, so I think it was just really fun to play there. Very nice ambiance." In the Round of 16, Giorgi will take on 20th seeded Russian Daria Kasatkina, who continued her excellent form with a 6-3, 6-2 victory over America’s Shelby Rogers. Another Russian, Veronika Kudermetova notched a career milestone by getting through to the last 16 of a Grand Slam for the first time in her career after No. 3 Paula Badosa of Spain retired trailing 6-3, 2-1 due to a right calf injury. The world No. 4 had previously beaten Kudermetova twice this year, in Indian Wells and Madrid, with the loss of just eight combined games in the two matches. To further stretch her best-ever major run, Kudermetova will next face No. 22 seeded American Madison Keys for a spot in the quarterfinals. With Sabalenka and Badosa’s upsetting exits on Saturday, world No.1 Iga Swiatek in the sole Top 10 player to make it through the French Open's first three rounds. (With input from WTA Official)
