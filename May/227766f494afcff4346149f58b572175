Blinken's speech, full of false information, exaggerating the "China threat" and spreading erroneous remarks about Taiwan, once again exposed its purpose of supporting Taiwan to contain China and trying to prevent the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation, Zhu Fenglian, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Friday. She made the remark at a press conference in response to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken's speech on policy toward China. Noting that the one-China principle is the foundation of China-U.S. relations, Zhu said that the U.S. side has broken stipulations on the Taiwan issue in the three China-U.S. joint communiques. China strongly opposes the frequent collusion between the U.S. and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and stands firmly against U.S. arms sales to the Taiwan region, she said. Zhu then said the mainland will work with the greatest sincerity and exert utmost efforts to achieve peaceful reunification, but does not renounce the use of force and reserves the option of taking all necessary measures. At the briefing, the spokesperson also reiterated that there is only one China in the world, that the Taiwan region is an inalienable part of the Chinese territory, and that the government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China. "No one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity," she added.
