China's financial regulators announced on Sunday it will cut the lower limit of interest rates on home loans based on the corresponding tenor of the Loan Prime Rate (LPR) for first-time homebuyers to support housing demand and healthy development of the property sector. The mortgage rate floor for first-time homebuyers is cut to 20 basis points below the corresponding tenors of LPR, and the minimum mortgage rate for second-home buyers remains unchanged, according to a statement jointly issued by the People's Bank of China (PBOC) and China's Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission. The central bank reiterated in the statement that "housing is for living in, not speculation". China's household lending dropped in April with mortgages contracting by 60.5 billion yuan ($8.91 billion) in the month. The top 100 property developers in the country saw their sales plunge 16.2 percent in April compared with that in March. Banks in more than 100 cities have cut mortgage rates by 20 to 60 basis points or started easing property purchase restrictions since March, PBOC officials said in April.
