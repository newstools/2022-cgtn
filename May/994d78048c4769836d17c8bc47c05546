Various cities across China have been hit by heavy downpours since May 29, and firefighters have worked hard to evacuate the affected residents. With more than 100 millimeters average precipitation battering central China's Hunan Province, 188 workers were stranded at a flooded construction site in the early morning of May 30. In Hunan's neighboring province of Guizhou, the downpour left the Gui'an New Area with large areas of waterlogging, trapping many cars and people on road on May 30.
