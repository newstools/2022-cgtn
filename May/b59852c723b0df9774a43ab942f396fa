The BRICS countries, namely Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, launched a new cooperation committee on Wednesday to share remote sensing satellites and data. The new committee, composed of space agencies from the five countries, held its first meeting by video on the same day. The shared data will help the countries to better protect environment, reduce disaster risks and deal with climate change, according to Zhang Kejian, head of China National Space Administration. Zhang said the committee involves higher-level cooperation among BRICS countries. The meeting also passed technical standards of data sharing and the procedures for observation cooperation. The five space agencies signed an agreement for cooperation in remote sensing satellite data sharing in August 2021.
