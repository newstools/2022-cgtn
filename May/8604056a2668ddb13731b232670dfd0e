The governing bodies of men's and women's tennis, the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) and Women's Tennis Association (WTA), both announced on Friday that they would not award ranking points for this year's Wimbledon, following the decision of the All England Club (AELTC) to ban Russian and Belarusian players from the tournament. Top-ranked players affected include Daniil Medvedev, Andrey Rublev, Aryna Sabalenka and Victoria Azarenka. The ATP said in a statement that the ability of players of any nationality to enter tournaments based on merit, and without discrimination, is fundamental to the tour, and likewise for the WTA. "The decision by Wimbledon to ban Russian and Belarusian players from competing in the UK this summer undermines this principle and the integrity of the ATP Ranking system," the ATP statement reads. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) will also withdraw ranking points for Wimbledon junior and wheelchair events. One month ago, the AELTC revealed its decision to exclude entries from Russia and Belarus to the 2022 Wimbledon which will run from June 27 to July 10. (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
