World No. 1 Iga Swiatek of Poland won her fifth WTA Tour title in a row after sweeping past seventh seeded Tunisian Ons Jabeur, 6-2, 6-2 to defend her Internazionali BNL d'Italia title in Rome. The 20-year-old Pole extends her winning streak to 28 consecutive matches and ends Jabeur's career-best 11-match winning streak which began with the Tunisian's title run at the Madrid Open last week. "At the beginning of the tournament, I didn't know it would be possible to keep up the streak and with all the wins," Swiatek said. "I'm pretty happy I did it really step by step and I just focused on the right things because I think it led to all the success this week." The world No. 1 is now 8-1 in WTA finals and has run off 16 consecutive sets in title contests. Having won the titles in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami, Stuttgart and Rome, Swiatek is now the fourth player in the 2000s to win five or more consecutive tournaments, after Venus Williams in 2000, Justine Henin in 2007-2008 and Serena Williams in 2013. Swiatek is just the second player to ever win four or more WTA 1000 titles in a single season, after 23-time Grand Slam champion Williams won five in 2013. The 2020 French Open winner has not lost more than five games in a final since losing the first WTA final she ever contested at 2019 Lugano. On the doubles side, Russian pair Veronika Kudermetova and Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova upset second seeds Gabriela Dabrowski and Giuliana Olmos, 1-6, 6-4, [10-7] to win their first title as a team.
