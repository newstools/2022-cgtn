Despite its gigantic size, the Sichuan takin is a herbivore native to China. They love to gather in a group of three to five, or as many as 45, and wander in forests of Sichuan and Gansu provinces. Thanks to its strong hooves, Sichuan takins can easily climb vertically on a steep cliff for food according to the season. They can also jump as high as two meters when they feel threatened. Apart from plants, Sichuan takins are salt aficionados. From June to October, especially at noon, they come to the saline land in the forest to lick salt and stay for over half an hour. The salt helps them obtain minerals that are good for their health.
