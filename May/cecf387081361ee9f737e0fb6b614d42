Real Madrid forward Karim Benzema equalled Cristiano Ronaldo's record of scoring the most knockout-stage goals in a single season of the UEFA Champions League. Benzema achieved this feat against Manchester City on Thursday at the Santiago Bernabeu stadium in Madrid, Spain. It was a remarkable tenth Champions League goal for Benzema this season, just in the knockout stages. The 34-year-old had already netted twice against Manchester City in the semi-final first leg last week. He also found the back of the net four times across two legs against Chelsea in the quarters, and on three occasions against PSG in the last-16. And his effort against Pep Guardiola's side at the Bernabeu in the 6-5 aggregate win took his knockout tally to double digits in just six games. The French striker who is having the best season of his career till date will have the opportunity to overtake Ronaldo when his side plays against Liverpool in the UCL final.
