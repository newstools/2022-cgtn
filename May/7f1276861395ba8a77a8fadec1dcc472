U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday visited Buffalo, New York, where a gunman killed 10 people over the weekend in what appeared to be a racially motivated attack. Biden was expected to meet with victims' families during his visit. An 18-year-old white man shot and killed 10 people and injured three others at a supermarket in Buffalo on Saturday. Most of the victims were black. The shooting is being investigated as a hate crime and an act of racially motivated violent extremism, U.S. authorities said.
