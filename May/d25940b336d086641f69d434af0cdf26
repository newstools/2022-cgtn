The Group of Seven (G7) countries have reached concrete agreements on phasing out coal power generation and expanding renewable energy production, German Environment Minister Steffi Lemke was quoted by German media outlet RTL/ntv as saying on Friday. The pledge would mark the first commitment from the G7 to quit coal-fueled power, the use of which needs to decrease if the world is to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.
