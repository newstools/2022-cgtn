China has "spontaneously" lowered its overall tariff level from 9.8 percent in 2010 to 7.4 percent currently. Since the 18th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2012, "China has deepened practical cooperation in the financial field and strengthened multilateral and bilateral financial dialogue," the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee said on Tuesday. In the past decade, China has proposed the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, promoted the establishment of the New Development Bank and advanced the Belt and Road Initiative, said the department.
