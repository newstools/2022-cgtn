Defending champion Iga Swiatek thrashed Aryna Sabalenka 6-2, 6-1 to extend her winning streak to 27 matches and reach the final in Rome. Sabalenka took a medical timeout late in the second set and saved a match point at 5-1 down, but Swiatek earned a fourth break of serve to take the match. The world number one pole moved within one victory of a fifth consecutive title after the 2020 French open champion won her last four events in Doha, Indian Wells, Miami and Stuttgart this season. "I'm just constantly surprising myself that I can do better and better. I feel like I actually can believe now that the sky's the limit. That's the fun part, for sure." Swiatek said after the match. Swiatek will face Ons Jabeur in Sunday's final. Jabeur erased a match point before overcoming Daria Kasatkina 4-6, 6-1, 7-5 on Saturday. "Very happy to back that other final in Madrid," Jabeur said afterward. It is 11 straight match wins for Tunisia, who also reached her second straight WTA 1000 final after lifting the Madrid Open trophy last week. Jabeur has won two of her three meetings with Swiatek, including at Wimbledon last year. The No.9 seed became the first player to reach three clay-court finals on tour in a single season since Simona Halep in 2017.
