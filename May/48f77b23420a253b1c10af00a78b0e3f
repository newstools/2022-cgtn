The world's largest "back-to-back" flexible direct current (DC) project was built in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area of China on Saturday. The project is the first of its kind to realize regional interconnection among power grid load centers. The project covers a new flexible DC converter station each in Guangzhou and Dongguan to divide the power grid in the Greater Bay Area into two independent "back-to-back" smart grids. "This project is the first in the world to reasonably partition the complex structure of a power grid, and the first to use flexible DC technology for interconnection of the partitioned grids, which can send electricity to each other at normal time, and support each other quickly in less than 0.1 seconds under fault condition, thus greatly improving the security and stability of power supply in the Greater Bay Area," Rao Hong, chief technologist of the China Southern Power Grid Corporation (CSG), told China Media Group. The construction of the project, with an investment of 9.9 billion yuan (about $1.48 billion), took two years, and led to an investment of about 8 billion yuan in the upstream and downstream industry chains. "Such a grid structure could avoid 'putting all eggs in one basket' and greatly reduce the risk of large-scale power failure caused by mutual involvement. When mutual support is needed, it is available via the outer ring. Meanwhile, the grid has become more flexible, which is more conducive to large-scale new energy access," said Ling Yizhen with the Infrastructure Department of Guangdong Power Grid Company under the CSG. The project will also allow the power grid in the Greater Bay Area to absorb and utilize wind power, photovoltaic power and other new energies on a larger scale, and is able to accommodate an additional six million kW of clean energy of offshore wind power and hydropower from western regions this year.
