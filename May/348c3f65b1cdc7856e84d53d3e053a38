U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday he does not know whether the leaked Supreme Court draft abortion ruling is genuine or reflects a final decision, but his administration will be ready to respond to protect abortion rights if a ruling is issued. The U.S. Supreme Court reportedly looks set to overturn the historic Roe v. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide, according to a leaked draft opinion published by Politico on Monday. "I believe that a woman's right to choose is fundamental," Biden said in a statement, adding that if Roe v. Wade is overturned, elected officials will need to protect a woman's right to choose and voters will need to elect pro-choice officials in November's midterm elections.
