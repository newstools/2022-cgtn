As rural revitalization continues, more young people in southwest China's Sichuan Province have decided to find employment in smaller cities or villages. Liu Xiaohong is one of them. He studied tea planting and processing at university, and after graduation, he returned to his village in Sichuan to contribute to the local tea industry. Sichuan officials are providing graduate-oriented loans to help people like Liu start businesses in villages.
