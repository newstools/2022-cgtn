Self-proclaimed witnesses at a Uygur Tribunal based in the UK claimed that China was allegedly committing genocide against Uygurs in Xinjiang. Their claims ranged from forced abortions to sterilizations through the removal of 2,000 wombs each year. A witness even said she saw more than 20 forced abortions and forced sterilizations a day carried out by doctors in Hotan Prefecture People's Hospital. CGTN visited the hospital and talked to some medical workers there.
