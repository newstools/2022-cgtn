Diego Maradona's "Hand of God" shirt, which the former Argentina captain wore when his handball gave "La Albiceleste" the lead in a 2-1 quarter-final win over England at the 1986 World Cup, was sold for £7 million pounds ($8.75 million US dollars) at an auction on Wednesday. Maradona, who went on to score what some describe as the "Goal of the Century" in the same game, swapped shirts at the end of the game with England midfielder Steve Hodge. Former Nottingham Forest player Hodge put the shirt up for auction on April 22nd, with the famed article of clothing beating the £4-6 million pounds estimate placed on it by auction house Sotheby's. Maradona, who passed away in November 2020, claimed that it was the "Hand of God" that knocked the ball over England goalkeeper Peter Shilton and into an empty net 51 minutes into the quarter-final in Mexico City.
