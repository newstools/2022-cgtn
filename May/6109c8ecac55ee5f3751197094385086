2021 French Open runner-up Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova of Russia announced on Tuesday that she is ending her season early and withdrawing from all events – including the upcoming French Open – due to lingering pain from a knee injury. The 30-year-old Russian reached her maiden major final at Roland Garros last year, losing to Czech Republic's Barbora Krejcikova in three sets. "I'm very sad to say that I'm forced to withdraw from Roland Garros and the rest of the tournaments this year!" Pavlyuchenkova wrote on Instagram. "I have been playing this in my head for the last week and it has been a really tough decision to make, as Roland Garros was always very special to me, especially after a dream run last year," she said, "But due to the pain for a long time, now the injury is limiting me physically and mentally to compete and practice fully." The decision comes just a few days after the Russian claimed her sixth WTA doubles title at the Italian Open partnered by compatriot Veronika Kudermetova. "The last two tournaments has showed me that the pain was still there and I wasn't ready," Pavlyuchenkova added. "I have decided to take more time and come back stronger next year! " The 30-year-old complained of a left knee injury following her third-round loss at the Australian Open in January and has only played three tournaments in 2022. Pavlyuchenkova had one of the best seasons of her career last year, rising to a career-high world ranking of No. 11 after the French Open and then claiming the gold medal in mixed doubles at the Tokyo Olympics alongside Andrey Rublev.
