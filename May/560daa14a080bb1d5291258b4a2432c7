At 8:56 p.m., under the reflection of the azure Earth, the Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft successfully docked with Tianhe, the core module of the Tiangong Space Station. Seven hours after launch, the spacecraft rendezvoused with China's under-construction space station using fast-docking technology. It carried over 200 pieces of equipment and supplies for the nation's upcoming Shenzhou-14 crewed mission for six months. This is exclusive footage of Tianzhou-4 approaching from the perspective of the Tianhe core module.
