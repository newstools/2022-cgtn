Former Women's Tennis Association (WTA) World No.2 Agnieszka Radwanska posted a picture of herself on the court on Instagram on Thursday saying she may participate in the Polish League and would be back at Wimbledon to play in the Women's Legends Doubles match this year. The 33-year-old is a history-maker for Polish tennis after becoming the first woman from her country to reach the final at any Grand Slams in the Open Era, and also the first to win the WTA Finals. In all, Radwanska won 20 career WTA singles titles, including the 2015 WTA Finals at Singapore, as well as three noteworthy titles at the Premier Mandatory level, two in Beijing and one in Miami. Meanwhile, the Pole has also won two WTA International level titles in China at 2015 Tianjin and Shenzhen in 2016. In addition to her Wimbledon runner-up finish, she reached the semifinals of the Australian Open in 2014 and 2016, the quarterfinals of the 2013 French Open, and also the round of 16 of the US Open five times. On the doubles side, Radwanska claimed two tour-level titles, including 2007 Istanbul Open with younger sister Urszula and the 2011 Miami open with Daniela Hantuchova. Known as one of the most creative players on tour and nicknamed “Ninja” for her deft skills and imaginative style of play, she was also voted WTA fan favorite six consecutive years. After retiring from the professional game in 2018, she was named as one of the WTA Finals Shenzhen Legend Ambassadors, before becoming a mother in July 2020.
