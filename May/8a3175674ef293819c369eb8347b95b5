Half of Shanghai's 16 districts have achieved "zero-COVID" status, city officials told a press conference on Wednesday. "A total of eight districts in Shanghai and parts of the city's Pudong New Area have achieved zero-COVID status," Zhao Dandan, deputy director of Shanghai's health commission, said. Data also showed that the city recorded no cases outside areas under the strictest curbs on Tuesday. Despite achieving that significant milestone, officials said it was not yet time to ease curbs. "We must clearly recognize that the current situation is not stable, and the risk of a rebound still remains," Zhao said. The city also saw seven new local deaths related to COVID-19, with an average age of 87.3. The direct causes of the deaths were underlying diseases, the commission said. Shanghai registered 228 confirmed locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and 1,259 local asymptomatic cases on Tuesday, the municipal health commission said Wednesday. Seven other provincial-level regions on the mainland also reported new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases, including Beijing with 24 and central China's Henan Province with 22.
