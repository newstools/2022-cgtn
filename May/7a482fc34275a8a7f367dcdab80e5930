China's Giant Panda National Park's population of pandas and other rare wild animals has grown since it officially opened in October last year.The Giant Panda National Park, one of China's first national parks dedicated to a single species, covers more than 22,000 square kms in parts of Sichuan, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces.About 87.7 percent, or 19,300 square kilometers, of the Giant Panda National Park, falls in southwest China's Sichuan Province which is home to 1,227 wild giant pandas."This is hair from a tufted deer, which is under second-class national-level protection in China. They are companion animals to the giant panda," said Zeng Zejun, deputy head of Dayi Station of the Giant Panda National Park.Sichuan's ecological system has progressed greatly due to the park's establishment."Before the establishment of the Giant Panda National Park, a waterfall like this was rarely seen and only appeared after heavy rain. Now as we opened the national park, we closed small hydropower stations so that more water could gather in the lake. A big waterfall like this now can be found in several places in this national park," said Zeng.During the construction of the national park, Sichuan restored 5,600 hectares of areas as giant panda corridors to minimize the impact of human activities on giant panda habitat."The footage in the past seven days recorded the movement of Chinese antelopes and blue sheep. One infrared camera can store a maximum of 3,000 photos and videos," said a ranger at the Giant Panda National Park.Giant Panda National Park now has more than 1,500 infrared cameras that capture the activities of more than 300 giant pandas and other rare wild animals.
