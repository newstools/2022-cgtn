Syrian President Bashar al-Assad visited Iran on May 8 to meet with Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Ebrahim Raisi in Tehran. This is his second visit to Iran since the outbreak of the Syrian conflict in 2011, with his last visit to Iran in February 2019. "The experience of Iran and Syria has shown that close cooperation among countries can defeat American hegemony," he said.
