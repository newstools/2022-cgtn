The golden eagle is the king of the sky in the alpine forest of the Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province. The bird gets its name from the iconic light golden-brown plumage on its head and neck, which glitters like gold in the sunshine. As an aerial raptor, the golden eagle has a robust physique with a wingspan of over two meters. The fierce raptor feeds on a variety of prey, including pheasants, pikas, Himalayan marmots, mountain weasels and even blue sheep. The species is currently under first-class state protection in China.
