Thousands of fans lined the streets of the city as double cup-winners Liverpool returned home for an open-top bus parade on Sunday that took place amid a flood of conflicting emotions. The Premier League and Champions League trophies eluded Jurgen Klopp's men in the last eight days, but they returned from Paris to a heroes' welcome as tens of thousands of fans lined an eight-mile route to see them parade the FA Cup and Carabao Cup – plus the FA Women's Championship. "This is the best club in the world. I don't care what other people think," said Liverpool manager Klopp. A quadruple of major trophies, for possibly the greatest ever single season by a club in football history, was in tantalizing reach. Except Manchester City pulled off a stunning late comeback – three goals in five minutes – in a final-day win in the Premier League last weekend to finish one point ahead of Liverpool. Then Klopp's team lost 1-0 to Real Madrid in the Champions League final on Saturday to be denied a seventh European Cup. The history books will say Liverpool finished the 2021-22 season with the League Cup and FA Cup trophies, both secured after penalty shootouts following 0-0 draws. (With input from AP)
