Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa on Tuesday extended the national curfew until the morning of May 11 after seven people were killed and 231 injured in clashes in Colombo on Monday. The president appealed and urged people to remain calm, irrespective of political affiliations. "All efforts will be made to restore political stability through consensus, within constitutional mandate & to resolve economic crisis," he said on twitter. Sri Lankan Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa resigned on Monday after deadly clashes broke out between his supporters and anti-government protesters. UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet has condemned the escalating violence in Sri Lanka amid a severe economic crisis and called on the authorities to prevent further unrest. "I am deeply worried about the escalation of violence after supporters of the prime minister attacked peaceful protesters yesterday, May 9, and the subsequent mob violence against members of the ruling parties," Bachelet said.
