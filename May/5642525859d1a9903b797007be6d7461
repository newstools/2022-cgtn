Taihang Grand Canyon, a national forest and geological park, is currently welcoming what some say is the best season to visit. One of the best-known spots there is Baquanxia or Baquan valley, stretching as long as 13 kilometers and boasting diverse geological structures. The scenic spot is also home to a high-rise glass elevator, one of the tallest and fastest elevators in the world.
