Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp described his much-changed side as "Ferraris in the garage," after seeing them come back from 1-0 down to secure a 2-1 away win at Southampton on Tuesday, in the process taking the Premier League title race to the final day. "I am so happy about the performance," said Klopp. "It was a bit touching. Honestly, you think: 'Wow, these boys. It is like having Ferraris in the garage.' You let them out and they do it like this. Harvey (Elliott), I'm not sure the last time he played; Curtis (Jones) no rhythm, he has only played from time to time; Takumi Minamino, it is a crime he is not playing more often, these kinds of things really. (Alex) Oxlade(-Chamberlain) did not even play and he is in outstanding shape. So, all these kinds of things. It is really tough for the boys sometimes. Whatever happens this year, happens because of this group. It's exceptional and tonight they showed that again." Klopp made nine changes to the team that lifted the FA Cup at Wembley last Saturday for the match at St Mary's. The gamble was rewarded with Takumi Minamino, who finished last season on loan at Southampton, and Joel Matip overturning Nathan Redmond's early strike to secure the win for Liverpool.
