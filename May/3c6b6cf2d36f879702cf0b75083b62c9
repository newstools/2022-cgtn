Goalkeeper and captain Manuel Neuer has signed a contract extension with Bayern Munich, the Bundesliga powerhouse announced on Monday. With the new deal in place, the 36-year-old World Cup-winning German international will stay at the Allianz Arena until 2024. "Manuel Neuer is a player whose place in FC Bayern history is already secure. We're looking forward to the next years with the best goalkeeper in the world in our goal," Bayern president Herbert Hainer said in a statement. "I'm very pleased that my journey continues at FC Bayern," Neuer added. "We'll have a very good team again with which we can play for every title. As a goalkeeper, captain and leader, I want to be the support and a key factor in our big goals. We want to extend our title record and compete again for the DFB Cup and Champions League." Neuer joined Bayern from Schalke 04 in the summer of 2011 and has helped the club win 10 straight Bundesliga titles, five DFB-Pokal championships and two UEFA Champions League titles, among other honors. He has tallied 315 Bundesliga wins while securing 214 clean sheets, both league records. With the German national team, he won the 2014 FIFA World Cup, and also holds the national team record of shutouts by conceding no goal at all in 47 games. Bayern CEO Oliver Khan, himself a legendary goalkeeper with the club and with Germany, reacted to Monday's announcement: "Manuel Neuer... has been setting the standard around the world for years. It's a huge achievement to be so consistently world class for such a long time. We're very happy to have extended his contract. Manuel is a defining figure in the history of FC Bayern." Neuer's decision to stay should make Bayern feel comfortable after going through transfer drama with Robert Lewandowski, who has rejected any extension offer and is determined to leave for Barcelona. Center-back Niklas Sule will join Borussia Dortmund as a free agent after this season.
