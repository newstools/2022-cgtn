The 2023 Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup will be relocated from the original host China, the local organizing committee announced on Saturday. The decision was made after the Chinese Football Association (CFA), AFC and the local organizing committee held joint discussions. A new host will be decided soon. The top Asian football tournament was slated to take place in 10 Chinese cities between June 16 and July 16, 2023. The announcement said the "Chinese Organizing Committee cannot pledge at this moment to hold next year's Asian Cup competition under a fully open model" because of COVID-19, adding the event will be moved elsewhere. The last Asian Cup was held in the United Arab Emirates in 2019. Qatar defeated Japan in the final game to win the title.
