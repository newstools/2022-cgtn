Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin reiterated that the country's relationship with Russia can "withstand the new test of changing international situation," and that it has maintained the right direction. Wang made the remarks on Tuesday when asked to comment on a recent quote by Sergey Lavrov, Russian foreign minister, that Moscow looks to strengthen its economic ties with China "even faster" amid mounting sanctions coming from the West. Russia initiated a "special military operation" in Ukraine since late February, and in response, the Western nations have imposed unprecedented sanctions. "Cooperation between China and Russia has strong endogenous power and independent value. It is not aimed at third parties and will not be influenced by the outside world," Wang said at a regular briefing. China and Russia will continue to work to promote "genuine multilateralism," and oppose international hegemony, Wang added.
