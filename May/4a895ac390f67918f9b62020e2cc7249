A print art exhibition of nonagenarian Chinese artist Huang Yongyu was unveiled on May 18, International Museum Day. A collaborative effort between Suzhou Museum and Beijing Fine Art Academy, the exhibition presents 78 sets of woodblock prints and carved woodblocks created by Huang, chronicling his artistic achievements from the 1940s to the 1990s. Titled "Carved into Wood – Huang Yongyu's Prints Exhibition," it features Huang's woodblock illustrations of classic literary works and lifelike printmaking portraits. Over his artistic career spanning more than half a century, this celebrated Chinese artist has explored various art forms. He is also a prolific writer of poems, fiction and prose. The exhibition traces back to the root of his artistic passion – woodcutting – and showcases many of his representative works, including "Ashima" and "Spring Tide." Huang Yongyu is famous for his "Ashima" artwork, which comprises a set of 10 paintings. Five of them are now on display. Jiang Weida, director of the Exhibition Department at the Suzhou Museum, explained that Huang created the illustrations during a visit to southwest China's Yunnan Province in the 1950s, inspired by the narrative epic poem "Ashima" written by the Sani people, a branch of the ethnic Yi people. The artwork features a headdress with elaborate ethnic patterns, while the wearer's profile is depicted using simple strokes, presenting a strong contrast and visual impact. Huang Yongyu was born in central China's Hunan Province in 1924. He left his hometown of Fenghuang County while still in his teens and traveled around the country. His woodcut prints and writings brim with his passion for and profound insights into people from various groups and walks of life and the spirit of the times. The 98-year-old has attached great importance to this exhibit and recorded a special video for the museum to express his blessing. The exhibition is expected to run until July 24.
