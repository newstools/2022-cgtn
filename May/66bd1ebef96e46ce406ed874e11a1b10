Neymar showed his full range of flicks, tricks and goal-scoring skills while playing against the two winning teams at the Neymar Jr's Five World Final event in Doha, Qatar on Tuesday. The night was a celebration of the football style in Brazil, with the victorious teams in the mixed category and women's competitions – Consagrados and Fortal Balls – both hailing from the South American nation. "I really like how they played," said Neymar Jr, "I was supporting Brazil, of course. I'm always a fan of Brazil, and I'm happy that the title is going home again." "It's amazing for us, it's like a dream," said Consgrados player Henry Hatakeyama. "We played in 2018 but we lost in the quarterfinals. That made us more determined to come back and win it this time. We were worried when they scored, but I put my hope in God, and we did it." Playing against their idol was an added bonus to go along with the titles, and Neymar didn't disappoint, scoring two goals against Consagrados before also finding the net against Fortal Balls. Neymar will be hoping for more glory in Doha later in the year when he returns with his Brazil teammates for the 2022 World Cup. (With input from AP)
