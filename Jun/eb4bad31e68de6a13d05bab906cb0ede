New signing Marko Dabro scored in the 86th minute to help Beijing Guoan battle past Tianjin Jinmen Tiger 1-0, while a stoppage-time goal by Nebojsa Kosovic helped Meizhou Hakka edge out Shenzhen 2-1 in the Chinese Super League (CSL) on Monday. Both Beijing and Tianjin failed to create solid opportunities for most of the match. With four minutes to go, Croatian forward Dabro, who joined the CSL side from NK Lokomotiva, found the net after collecting a cross from Zhang Yuning. It was the second straight victory for the capital club, who held off eight-man Chengdu 3-2 last Wednesday. Guoan shuffled their imports following the league's imposition of a strict salary cap in the offseason, replacing the likes of Renato Augusto and Cedric Bakambu with Dabro, Samuel Adegbenro, and Samir Memisevic. In Monday's other Super League match, Meizhou broke the deadlock in the 40th minute when Yang Yilin scored with a powerful strike from the edge of the penalty area. But in the 48th minute, Shenzhen drew level through Romain Alessandrini's equalizer. The game appeared headed for a draw before Kosovic scored in the 91st minute to secure the win for Hakka. "I think both teams played well in today's game. We still have a lot to learn regardless of the victory," said 23-year-old midfielder Yang. It was the first CSL win for newly promoted Meizhou, who now sit 10th in the 18-team league. Shenzhen, with two victories after three matches, are fifth, ahead of Beijing on goal difference, while Tianjin rank 13th.  (With input from Xinhua)
