The Tampa Bay Lightning hit the ice one last time before the Wednesday's Game One of the Stanley Cup Final against the Colorado Avalanche. The two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Tampa Bay Lightning are the first team to play in three-straight Stanley Cup Finals since the Edmonton Oilers went to three in a row from 1983-85, also attempting to become the first team to win three-consecutive Stanley Cups since the New York Islanders won four in a row from 1980-83 and the fourth franchise all-time in the NHL to do so. Speaking at a media day on the eve of the first big showdown between the two teams, Lightning defenceman Cal Foote expects "a tough challenge" for his team. The 23-year-old was quick to praise the "dynamic" Avalanche and warn that his team would have to be on top of their game. (With input from AP and NHL officials)
