Russia's "special military operation" in Ukraine will go on at an accelerated pace, said Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov after holding a meeting with Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, RIA news agency reported Friday. Shoigu has identified new tasks that imply the improvement of further tactics, Kadyrov said. The measures taken would contribute to conducting the military operation at a faster pace, he added, according to the report. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov declined to comment on Kadyrov's statement when asked by reporters on Friday. "As for the course of the special military operation, we agreed that we would not comment on this in any way, these questions should be addressed to the Ministry of Defense," the spokesperson said. Russia will continue its military operation in Ukraine until all its goals have been achieved, Peskov told reporters. "One of the main goals of the operation is to protect people in the DNR and LNR. Measures have been taken to ensure their protection and certain results have been achieved," he said, referring to Donetsk and Luhansk.
