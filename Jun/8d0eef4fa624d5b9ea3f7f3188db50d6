Passing on the Olympic spirit, the Chinese Olympic Committee (COC) Wednesday launched public fitness activities and an online relay challenge for its 36th Olympic Day. Olympic and world champions as well as other star athletes have been invited to join the online relay and other activities under the theme "Join Hands to Create a Better World." Moreover, the COC will also donate sports gear to support the development of sports among the youth in rural areas. Electronic certificates with signatures from the presidents of the International Olympic Committee as well as the COC will also be awarded to participants besides medals and other gifts. The Olympic Day falls on June 23 every year in commemoration of the birth of the modern Olympic Games. It started in 1948 as an attempt to unite the world in sports, regardless of age, gender or athletic skills. China has been part of the campaign since 1987 and has organized numerous events during the past decades.
