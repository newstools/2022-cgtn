Spanish rising star Carlos Alcaraz on Sunday admitted that he still has a lot to learn on grass, but he's looking to copy the best when it comes to movement on the court. "I'm trying to copy some things from the best ones. I always watch videos of Federer, Djokovic, Rafa, Andy (Murray) as well, trying to copy the moves and stuff from them," the 19-year-old told media at a press conference ahead of Wimbledon. The men's quarterfinals could see the Spaniard come up against the top-seeded Novak Djokovic, but a notable absence from Wimbledon is that of world No.1, Daniil Medvedev, due to the ban on Russian and Belarusian players. "It's tough for a tournament to not allow the No. 1 play. Everyone wants to see the No. 1 play in every tournament. Well, it's a pity to miss some of the best players in the world. That's all I can say," said Alcaraz, commenting on the matter. (With input from AP)
