Nyanpo Yuzee in Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, is an important breeding ground for close to a hundred black-necked cranes. A group of 16 local herders, 15 of them women, serve as volunteer wardens protecting the region's cranes. In the fragile environment high on the plateau, they are demonstrating how human beings should coexist with the wildlife around them.
