Italian Matteo Berrettini celebrated his first competitive match since undergoing hand surgery in March with a 6-2, 4-6, 6-3 victory over Radu Albot of Moldova at the Boss Open in Stuttgart on Wednesday afternoon. "I feel good, physically especially. I didn't take it for granted that I was stepping out and feeling good, especially after a surgery. I've never had one before. I'm really happy, I played three sets, so I'm feeling good," said Berrettini on his comeback win. The world No. 10 underwent a minor operation on his right hand in late March after opening his 2022 season with a 9-6 match record that included a third Grand Slam semi-final run at January's Australian Open. Last year's Wimbledon runner-up will face fellow Italian Lorenzo Sonego or home favorite Jan-Lennard Struff in the quarter-finals. (With input from AP and ATP Officials)
