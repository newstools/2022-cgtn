Chrisian Eriksen trained with his Denmark teammates on Thursday ahead of their UEFA Nations League group football game against Croatia. Denmark currently top their group after wins in France and Austria and should feel confident, despite their appreciation of the Croatia midfield, against a team who have lost five straight Nations League away games. Denmark head coach Kasper Hjulmand compared Croatia's Luka Modric to a vintage fine wine on Thursday, saying the 36-year-old is "getting better every day." Hjulmand acknowledged the formidable midfield Croatia have but singled out "unbelievable" Modric. The Croatia squad also trained on Thursday. Croatia have just one point after their first two games, both played at home: a 3-0 defeat to Austria and a 1-1 draw with World champions France. "In the first part, Denmark acts as an organized team, Eriksen returned to them as a great reinforcement. Denmark won 2 games, they beat Austria and France in 2 away games, unfortunately we didn't. One defeat, one draw but that doesn't diminish our chances for tomorrow. if we play the game as against France, then we can fight and we can win." said Zlatko Dalic, Croatia's coach.
