Former U.S. President Donald Trump lashed out at the January 6 House committee and some who testified to the panel after it shared findings during the first of several public hearings on Thursday evening, calling former Attorney General William Barr "weak and frightened" and denying claims he endorsed rioters’ chants to "Hang Mike Pence!" In a Truth Social post on Friday, Trump claimed he "NEVER said, or even thought of saying, 'Hang Mike Pence,'" calling it a fictional claim coming from "somebody looking to become a star."
