China's Zhang Shuai retired from the championship final with an injury to hand Beatriz Haddad Maia, who extended her winning streak on the WTA Tour to 10 matches after prevailing twice on Sunday, the title at the Birmingham Classic. The Brazilian was leading Zhang 5-4 in the opening set when China's World No. 54 declared she could no longer continue. The 33-year-old told the chair umpire she was retiring from the contest after consulting with the medical staff during the changeover. She then hugged Haddad Maia, with whom she claimed the doubles title in Nottingham last week. Both players reached the singles final at this event after winning rain-delayed semifinals earlier on Sunday. "I am really happy to be here in Birmingham," said Zhang. "So nice. And I can reach the singles and doubles finals. Amazing. All week I played unbelievably good. A couple of hours ago, we just finished long semifinals, a great match. I gave my best, but Bea (Haddad Maia) during the two weeks, she played so good." The 32nd-ranked Haddad Maia is only the third woman to earn two titles this year after Poland's Iga Swiatek and Tunisia's Ons Jabeur. She's also the first Brazilian to grab top honors in Birmingham's 40-year history. The 26-year-old, who will rise three spots to World No. 29 after lifting the second singles trophy of her career, is likely to be seeded at Wimbledon when the season's third Grand Slam begins next Monday.
