A suspect confessed to killing British journalist Dom Phillips and indigenous expert Bruno Pereira and led investigators to a site where human remains were dug up, federal police detective Eduardo Fontes told journalists on Wednesday. The police will work with Interpol to confirm the identity of the bodies, and additional arrests are still possible in the case, Fontes added. Phillips, 57, and Pereira, 41, were last seen on June 5 near the Javari Valley Indigenous Territory, which is in western Brazil, close to the borders of Peru and Colombia. The two men were in the Sao Rafael community and were returning by boat to the nearby city of Atalaia do Norte, when they disappeared.
