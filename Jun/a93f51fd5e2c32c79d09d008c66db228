The sport of rugby league on Tuesday banned transgender players from women's international matches while it develops a "comprehensive inclusion policy." Until then, "male-to-female (transwomen) players are unable to play in sanctioned women's international rugby league matches," said a statement from the 13-a-side game's governing body, the International Rugby League.
