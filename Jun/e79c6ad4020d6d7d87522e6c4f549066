Team China's Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong entered the Indonesian Masters mixed doubles final on Saturday, defeating South Korean pair Seo Seung-jae and Chae Yu-jung 2-1 from one set down. Meanwhile, China's Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan downed another South Korean pair in the women's doubles semifinal 2-0 to advance. In the six times the two mixed duos had played before, Zheng and Huang maintained a 6-0 winning record, whereas Seo and Chae posed a challenge to them in the opening set on Saturday, clinching five points straight to take the set 21-19 despite the Chinese pairs' leading edge. The Chinese duo had to come back from a set down to reclaim the match, winning the following sets 21-14, 21-12. In the women's doubles, Chen and Jia were in a desperate hunt of a top finish in Indonesia, as they have only won one title this year at the German Open in March. They downed South Korea's Jeong Na-eun and Kim Hye-jeong 21-12, 21-13 with ease to reach the final. (With input from Xinhua)
