German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Berlin has agreed to equip Ukraine with some of the advanced air defense systems it has been asking for at a news conference on June 8. He added that, despite this move, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries including Germany do not want to directly intervene militarily in regional conflicts. Ulrich Bruckner, Jean Monnet Professor for European Studies at Stanford University in Berlin, talks about how the supply of heavy weapons would affect the Ukraine crisis.
