China will launch its Shenzhou-14 crewed spaceship on Sunday, the China Manned Space Engineering Office (CMSEO) said at a press conference on Saturday. The spaceship is scheduled to blast off at 10:44 a.m. Beijing Time from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China in a Long March-2F Y14 rocket which is about to start propellant filling. Chinese astronauts Chen Dong, Liu Yang and Cai Xuzhe have been selected to carry out the Shenzhou-14 space mission, said the CMSEO. The launch of the Shenzhou-14 spaceship is the first manned space mission in the construction phase of China's space station. The three-member crew will live and work in orbit for six months, and welcome two lab modules – Wentian and Mengtian, the Tianzhou-5 cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-15 manned spaceship to dock, and rotate with the Shenzhou-15 crew in orbit before returning to Earth in December. The Shenzhou-14 crew will complete a series of tasks during their stay in the space station, including overseeing the lab modules' rendezvous, docking and transposition with the core module, completing in-orbit assembly and construction of the space station, completing the installation and commissioning of equipment inside and outside the space station cabin, conducting space science and technology experiments, and carrying out daily maintenance tasks. As the Shenzhou-14 spaceship enters orbit, it will adopt an autonomous fast rendezvous and docking mode and dock with the radial port of the core module. The CMSEO said the Tianzhou-3, Tianzhou-4 and core modules are in normal condition with all equipment working properly, ready for rendezvous and docking, and the entry of astronauts. Preparations for launching have basically been completed with the product quality of the Shenzhou-14 spaceship and the rocket under control. The crew is in good condition, and ground system facilities and equipment run stably.
