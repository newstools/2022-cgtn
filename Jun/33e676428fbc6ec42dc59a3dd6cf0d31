Chinese shuttlers advanced to the last eight in all five events at the Malaysia Open on Thursday, including the women's and men's singles, women's and men's doubles, and mixed doubles. The men's doubles pair, Liu Yuchen and Ou Xuanyi, were the last among their compatriots to advance, as their match was rescheduled at the last minute. They survived a scare against Malaysian pair Tan Kian Meng and Tan Wee Klong when the local duo tied the match at 1-1 and forced the match into the deciding set. Liu and Ou claimed the last set 21-14 to register Team China in all five events of the qurterfinals. In the women's singles, China's Chen Yufei, Wang Zhiyi and Han Yue took up three seats in the last eight. Han Yue, 23, had the toughest fight among the three in this round, as she fought back from one set down to defeat world No. 3, An Se-young from South Korea. Han lost the opening set 21-23, and almost lost the match when An led the second set 18-17. Han, however, won four points straight to take the set 21-18, retaining her hope to advance. Han found form in the last set when she expanded her leading edge from 6-4 to 11-4, leaving An no chance to reverse the game. Lu Guangzu was Team China's only shuttler remaining in the men's singles contention. Olympic medalists Chen Qingchen and Jia Yifan eased into the women's doubles next round 21-12, 21-9. For the other pair, Du Yue and Li Wenmei had to spend 91 minutes to earn a berth in the quarterfinals. Tokyo Olympics gold and silver medalists in the mixed doubles, Wang YiIyu and Huang Dongping, as well as compatriots Zheng Siwei and Huang Yaqiong, both moved past their respective opponents on Thursday.
