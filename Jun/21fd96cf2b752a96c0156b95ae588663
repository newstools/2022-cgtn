The United States national women's volleyball team beat China 25-21, 25-23, 25-21 at the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Nations League on June 18 in Quezon City, the Philippines. The Tokyo Olympic champions and world No.1 Team USA now has six wins and one defeat, leapfrogging China to sit second in the 16-team table in the preliminary phase. The top eight teams will be eligible to enter finals in Turkey in early July. Thanks to great serves and attacking, Team USA posed challenges in China's first pass. The Chinese team, comprised mostly of new, young players, lack experience in dealing with the high speed techniques of the American team. China led the third set 7-2 as Team USA made more offensive errors, but they managed to come from behind and snatch the victory due to powerful attacks and effective defense. Outside hitter Kathryn Plummer had a game-high 20 points for Team USA while Li Yingying led China with 13 points. "We had troubles in blocking and defense today. The U.S. was smoother in attack. I hope we can learn lessons from the game and find out our weakness." Chinese captain Yuan Xinyuan said after the match. Meanwhile, Bulgaria swept Canada 26-24, 25-22 and 25-21, and Belgium defeated Poland 20-25, 25-15, 22-25, 25-22 and 13-15 after an intense game. China, with five wins and two losses are in the third place, and will face top-ranked Japan on Sunday, who are on a seven game win streak.
