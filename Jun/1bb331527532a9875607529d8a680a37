Peru’s world No.5 Diego Elias overcame the challenge of England's world No.3 Mohamed ElShorbagy 3-0 overall to win the inaugural Mauritius Open in Grand Bay, Mauritius, on Saturday. Elias picked up where he left off from a stunning semi-final dismantling of world No.2 Paul Coll as he overcame ElShorbagy by an 11-2, 11-9, 11-8 contest at the RM Club to capture his 11th PSA title. The Peruvian finished the tournament without dropping a game. A delighted Elias said: "I'm really happy to be the first winner of a tournament like this. Hopefully, this keeps happening every year and I can come back next year and try and win it again." "I want to say thanks to Mohamed. He has been one of the best ever in squash, and I hope one day I can achieve what he has achieved and be like him when he loses. It’s like he is a winner too, I appreciate it a lot, you don’t see it very often." This was ElShorbagy's first final since changing his allegiance from Egypt to England earlier this week.
