China's consumption has shown a faster recovery during the Dragon Boat Festival holiday that ended on Sunday. The country saw 79.61 million domestic tourist trips during the three-day break, as projected by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. According to the ministry, revenue from tourism was 25.82 billion yuan (about $3.85 billion). The trips and tourism revenue decreased 10.7 and 12.2 percent, respectively, compared with the holiday last year, primarily because of the recent resurgence of the COVID-19 cases across the country. However, as the COVID-19 situation has been gradually under control since May, economic activities are speeding up recovery. The trips and tourism revenue generated from the holiday were 86.6 percent and 65.6 percent of that in 2019, respectively, ministry data shows. Compared with the pre-pandemic level, the recovery of the trips and tourism revenue from this year's Dragon Boat Festival holiday is better than the past holidays of Spring Festival, Qingming Festival and Labor Day holiday, CGTN calculated.
