Poverty alleviation in southern Xinjiang has enhanced the livelihood of the ethnic minorities. The natural conditions at the old Daryaboyi villages located in Xinjiang's Taklimakan Desert are harsh, and there is a severe shortage of food and drinking water. From 2015 to 2019, about 1,300 people of Daryaboyi in total moved to the new village in three stages as a result of poverty alleviation efforts.
