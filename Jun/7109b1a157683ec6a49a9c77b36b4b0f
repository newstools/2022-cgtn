Authorities in India say at least 19 people have been killed after a four-story residential building collapsed in the financial capital of Mumbai. The structure collapsed just before midnight on June 27. Fourteen people have been rescued, with more feared trapped under the rubble. Rescue workers were working to pull out debris and rubble until late on June 28, with work hampered by heavy rainfall. Building collapses are common in Mumbai during the monsoon season, mostly due to poor construction.
