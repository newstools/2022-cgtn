A massive, white 4,000-kilogram contraption jerks and tilts, while its electric motor whines as it pumps fluid into eight hydraulic cylinders moving the legs. 48-year-old engineer, mech pilot and founder of Exosapien technologies, Jonathan Tippet, has spearheaded the development of the world's first all-terrain exoskeleton mech suit out of Vancouver, Canada. The massive scale of the prosthesis has landed the machine a Guinness world record for the largest tetrapod exoskeleton.
