Former U.S. Open runner-up German Alexander Zverev took to Instagram on Saturday to share a grim update on his ankle injury with his fans. "It looks like I have a very serious injury, but the medical team, the doctors, are still checking on it and we will keep you updated," Zverev wrote in the post. "We will let you know as soon as we know more and yeah." The 25-year-old twisted his ankle near the end of the second set and was unable to walk off the court on his own accord, leaving in a  wheelchair instead. However, a few minutes after his exit, Zverev reentered the court on crutches to shake hands with Nadal and acknowledge the crowd. The tennis player also congratulated Nadal in his Instagram post. "I want to congratulate Rafa (Nadal) obviously, and incredible achievement, 14th final," Zverev wrote. "Hopefully he can go all the way and make some more history, but yeah, not an easy moment for me today, and I'll keep everybody updated. See you guys." (With input from AP)
