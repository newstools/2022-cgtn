Shanghai's metro trains got back on track after successful citywide COVID-19 restrictions. More than 900,000 passengers have boarded since it started running again on June 1, adhering to COVID-19 safety protocols to keep passengers safe. In the early stages of reopening, trains will run less frequently at five-minute intervals. But as the system gears up, trains will be running back on regular schedules again.
