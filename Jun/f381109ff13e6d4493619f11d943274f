Talks between rival Libyan institutions, which were aimed at breaking the deadlock over the rules for long-awaited elections, failed to resolve key differences, the United Nations said Thursday. "Disagreement persists on the eligibility requirements for the candidates in the first presidential elections," and while significant progress was made, "it remains insufficient as a basis to move forward towards comprehensive national elections," the UN's top Libya official Stephanie Williams said in a statement after the talks in Geneva.
