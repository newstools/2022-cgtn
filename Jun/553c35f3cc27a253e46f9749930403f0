The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) warned an Australian aircraft to leave after verifying it approached the Chinese airspace of Xisha Islands on May 26, Senior Colonel Tan Kefei, spokesperson for the Chinese Ministry of National Defense said on Tuesday. The PLA Southern Theater Command organized maritime and aerial forces to identify and verify an Australian P-8A ASW aircraft for "close-in reconnaissance," Tan said, warning Australia to stop provocations, strictly manage the actions of its naval and air forces, or face "serious consequences" in a statement. The Australian defense minister said that a PLA warplane intercepted the Australian aircraft and "imposed a safety threat" on June 5. The Australian aircraft seriously threatened China's sovereignty security, said Tan, adding that the Chinese military's response was professional, safe, reasonable and legitimate. China firmly oppose the Australian side "calling black white" and repeatedly spreading false information, Chinese Foreign Minster spokesperson Zhao Lijian also responded on Tuesday. Noting that "a healthy and stable China-Australia relationship serves the fundamental interests and common aspirations of the people of the two states," Zhao added that the Australian side should handle bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect and mutual benefit and bring China-Australia relations back to the right track.
