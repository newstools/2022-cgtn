The Biden administration revoked Wednesday a series of flight restrictions to Cuba imposed under former President Donald Trump, including ending a prohibition on U.S. airline flights to Cuban airports other than Havana. It came after Secretary of State Antony Blinken sent a letter to the Transportation Department on Tuesday asking it to revoke the restrictions, which had prevented U.S. airline flights and chartered flights from going to Cuban cities other than Havana.
