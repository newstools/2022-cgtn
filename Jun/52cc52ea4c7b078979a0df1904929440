China on Tuesday urged the "relevant country" to stop sending the wrong signals to "Taiwan independence" forces. Ma Xiaoguang, a spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to reports that You Si-kun, head of the legislative body of the Taiwan region, may visit the Czech Republic. Noting that You is a listed secessionist of "Taiwan independence," Ma said his visit and the so-called "parliamentary diplomacy" aims at colluding with external anti-China forces to seek "Taiwan independence." "We urge the government and members of the parliament of the relevant country to abide by the one-China principle, stop sending wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces and providing a stage and support for them to get involved in acts of secession," he said. In November 2021, the Chinese mainland announced measures to punish diehard secessionists, including You Si-kun, Su Tseng-chang and Joseph Wu, prohibiting them and their families from entering the Chinese mainland and the Hong Kong and Macao special administrative regions, and vowing to persecute them for life for criminal liability in accordance with law.
