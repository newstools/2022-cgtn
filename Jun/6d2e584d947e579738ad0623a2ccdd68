Nanzhi Quan is a traditional form of martial arts in south China's Guangdong Province. It has various hand techniques: the fist must be strong, fierce and forceful at every step, with fewer leg techniques. It is listed as an intangible cultural heritage of Guangdong. Sun Shuji has been practicing the Nanzhi Quan since he was 12 and now has his gym to teach children practicing this particular kung fu in Shantou City, southwest China's Guangdong province. Ever since he started practicing kung fu when he was 4 years old, he never skipped a day. "Your kung fu develops day by day. If you stop practicing because you are tired today, it is not kung fu," Sun shared his own philosophy about kung fu and life with us.
