Natan Eismont, the leading researcher of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, was interviewed by CGTN correspondent Evgenia Strygina on June 6. He said even with U.S. restrictions, China has still designed and built launch vehicles that are very important for space exploration. The restriction of China's access to the space launch services market is a loss to the world, he said.
