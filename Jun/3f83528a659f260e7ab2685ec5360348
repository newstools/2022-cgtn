France's lower house of parliament on Tuesday agreed to pick an MP from President Emmanuel Macron's coalition as the first woman speaker, despite the ruling alliance losing its majority in legislative elections. Yael Braun-Pivet, who had been serving as the minister for overseas territories, is the first woman to ever hold the post of speaker in the history of the National Assembly.
