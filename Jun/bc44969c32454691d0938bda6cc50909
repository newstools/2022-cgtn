China's General Administration of Customs on Wednesday revealed several cases of unqualified imported baby and children's products that failed to meet China's quality and safety standards. The products were from American luxury brand Ralph Lauren, French luxury fashion brand KENZO kids, Spanish fast-fashion label ZARA, and others. They were detected between June 2021 and May 2022 and accounted for 82 batches of imported infant and children items in five categories: clothing, shoes, toys, toothbrushes, and food contact products. According to the General Administration of Customs of the People's Republic of China (GACC), formaldehyde content, color fastness, pH value, the tensile strength of attachments and the durability of labels were among the primary detected with the clothing items. Meanwhile, the imported toys mainly had too-small parts and toxic and harmful substance content. The GACC has either returned or destroyed the unqualified goods in accordance with relevant laws and regulations, vowing to continue to strengthen the quality and safety inspection and supervision of imported baby products to effectively protect the life, health, and safety of babies and children.
