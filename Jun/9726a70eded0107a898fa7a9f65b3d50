Turkey started the 2022 FIVB Volleyball Women's Nations League campaign with a comfortable win (25-20, 25-19, 25-19) over Italy in Ankara on Tuesday. Without ace player Paola Egonu, the Italian team was less aggressive and not effective in making points. Turkey, ranking fourth in the world rankings, is only 11 points behind China now. The host will face China for the next game on Friday. With the absence of star spikers Zhu Ting and Zhang Changning, the Chinese squad is a combination of both veterans and young plyers, led by coach Cai Bin, as former coach Lang Ping stepped down after the Tokyo Olympics last year, when reigning champions China crashed out of the group stage, a scene not seen in decades. China's first opponents will be the Netherlands on Wednesday. The new line-up of Team China will fight to reach the last of eight at the campaign. At the same time, Thailand beat Bulgaria 25-20, 25-22, 25-20 in the opener.
