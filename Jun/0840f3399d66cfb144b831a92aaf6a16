Leaders of the Group of Seven (G7) will create a "climate club" by the end of the year that will allow willing nations to coordinate and speed up efforts to tackle global warming, they said in a statement on Tuesday. The club, open to all countries committed to the Paris climate pact, will have "a particular focus on the industry sector, thereby addressing risks of carbon leakage for emission intensive goods, while complying with international rules," the G7 said in a final statement after a three-day summit. The leaders "agreed to work together to accelerate a clean and just transition towards climate neutrality, while ensuring energy security," the statement said. They have also agreed to intensify their efforts to mitigate rising food prices and scarcity. Leaders from the UK, the U.S., Canada, Germany, France, Italy and Japan wrapped up their discussions in Berlin as part of this year's G7 Summit. Also in attendance are representatives from bodies including the United Nations, the European Union and the International Energy Agency, among other major and emerging economies including Argentina, South Africa and India.
