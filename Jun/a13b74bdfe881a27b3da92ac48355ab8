Wales ended a 64-year wait after edging Ukraine 1-0 in Sunday’s UEFA Path A qualifying final in Cardiff to reach the FIFA World Cup for just the second time ever, an achievement that manager Rob Page says has given the team an "unbelievable" feeling."If you could see the scenes in the changing room now, it is incredible," said Page. "It was a stressful game, it was. I thought Ukraine were excellent, I really did. But it is an incredible feeling and I am proud of the players and the supporters. I thought, from the first minute again, they were magnificent."The Welsh side’s advancement to international football’s biggest event comes six years after making history as only the second debuting squad to progress to the European Championship semifinals, with Sweden having previously accomplished the feat in 1992.The Red Dragons scored 10 goals during their continental coming out party at Euro 2016, the second-highest total for any British team at a major tournament behind England’s 11 during their World Cup title run in 1966. The steadily increasing list of accomplishments is only serving to further boost the team’s positive mentality."I think we are growing in confidence game-by-game. In 2016, when we got to the European Championship semifinals, did we punch above our weight? Yeah, absolutely," said Page. "In Baku, in the last Euros, did we surprise a lot of people by getting out of the group? Probably not. So expectations have changed."Wales will be slotted into Group B at this fall’s World Cup in Qatar along with England, Iran, and the U.S. But despite drawing a trio of strong opponents, including one of his side’s biggest rivals, the 47-year-old caretaker coach remains undaunted as he insists there is no way to predict the outcome of games between British home nations."We will roll up our sleeves and have a go," said Page. "But the England one is a leveler as well, isn't it? Anything can happen in the home nations matches, when you play against the home nations, so we will be full of confidence, like we always are, going into the World Cup games."
