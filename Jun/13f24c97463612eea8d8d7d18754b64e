Liverpool of the Premier League have "practically sealed" the transfer of 22-year-old Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez from Benfica of the Primeira Liga in a deal worth as much as 100 million euros (about $105.2 million), according to the Daily Mail. Tenfield Uruguay journalist Diego Jokas revealed on Friday that the transfer fee includes a base of 80 million euros (about $84.2 million) and 20 million euros (about $21 million) of achievable add-ons. Manchester United, long-time rivals of Liverpool, offered to buy the rising star as well but lost out. UD Almerica of La Liga, which brought Nunez from Uruguay's Penarol to Europe in 2019, confirmed the deal on Twitter and will receive 20 percent of the profit from the transfer. Having made 85 appearances in two seasons for Benfica, Nunez scored 48 goals and 16 assists for the Portuguese club. He was the top scorer of Primeira Liga and had six goals in the UEFA Champions League, netting against heavyweights Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Liverpool to help his side reach the quarterfinals. Liverpool came very close to having an epic 2021-22 season. They won the FA Cup and League Cup, but just failed to catch Manchester City in the contest for the Premier League championship. Then in the Champions League, Liverpool lost to Real Madrid 1-0 in the final at Stade de France on May 28. Though Liverpool seemed to be at an advantage against Real in the game, they didn't create enough of a goal-scoring threat, not to mention have real chances to score. Considering that Sadio Mane wants to leave for Bayern and Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino will become free agents in 2023, Liverpool have every reason to spend on enhancing the striker position, even by setting a team transfer record. City acquired Erling Haaland for 75 million euros (about $78.9 million) from Borussia Dortmund in early May, starting the arms race for next season's European football market.
