Denmark has been painted in yellow as people prepare for hosting the Tour de France Grand Depart from July 1 to 3. Europe's longest bridge, the Great Belt Bridge, can now be seen in yellow and the city Aabenraa hosting the last of the three stages in Le Grand Depart has painted a bridge there in yellow. The first stage will start from Copenhagen, where nine out of 10 people own a bicycle from the age of six. (With input from AP)
