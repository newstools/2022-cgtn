Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country is not ready to agree to a plan to export its grain. Zelenskyy's remarks come as Belarus said they are ready to let Ukrainian grain transit the country to Baltic Sea ports. Zelenskyy said he had discussed with Britain and Turkey the idea of a third country guaranteeing safe passage of Ukraine's grain exports through the Black Sea. However, he said the strongest guarantee of their safe passage would be with Ukrainian weaponry.
