U.S. President Joe Biden and representatives from 19 other Western Hemisphere countries on Friday unveiled a migration accord on the last day of the Summit of the Americas in an effort to address the continent's migration crisis, CBS News has reported. “Each of us is signing up to commitments that recognizes the challenges we all share, and the responsibility that impacts on all of our nations,” Biden said as he joined a group of regional leaders to sign the agreement, formally known as the Los Angeles Declaration on Migration and Protection. The pact centers on four key pillars, which are "stability and assistance for communities, expansion of legal pathways, humane migration management and coordinated emergency response," the White House said in a statement.
