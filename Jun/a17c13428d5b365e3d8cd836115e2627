The historic Yorkshire market town of Knaresborough welcomed teams from across England for their annual Bed Race on Saturday – back after a two-year hiatus because of the coronavirus pandemic. Part fancy dress pageant and part grueling time trial, the bed race was first staged in 1966 in order to raise money for local charities. It takes place over a 3.9km course through the streets with a crossing of the river Nidd just before the finish. The river crossing has had to be abandoned twice in 1972 and 1998 when torrential rain saw the Nidd flood. GH Brooks were the fastest team in the 2022 edition, making their way around the course in a rapid 12 minutes and 59 seconds. The fastest female team was the Welly Wheelers, who completed the course in 15 minutes and 14 seconds. Awards were also handed out for the best dressed team, the best decorated bed and there were individual honors for the fastest male and female junior teams. (With input from AP)
