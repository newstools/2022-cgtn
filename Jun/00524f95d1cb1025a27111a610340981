Cheese rolling returned to Gloucester on Sunday with hopefuls gathering at Coopers Hill, Brockworth in the UK to chase a 3.6 kilogram Double Gloucester down the famous hill. Held for the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic, the event saw participants gather at the very top of the almost vertical Cooper's Hill. With each race limited to 25 runners, several took place over the course of the afternoon. It was over within seconds for former champion Chris Anderson from Brockworth, who won his 23rd race after a year off in 2019. He holds a record 22 wins over 15 years and won three races in 2018, taking home three top cheeses as a result. However, this year might have been his last. "Never ever again. I was so scared this year," he said. "It's the most nervous I've ever been. No more. I'm going to stick to the crowd and enjoy it now. I wanted to win this year for my daughter." Abby Lampe from North Carolina in the U.S. smashed her win in the women's race. "I took a lot of tumbles, but I'm feeling good. Did I lose any teeth? I was worried I was going to lose my teeth or break an ankle, so all good. I can't believe I won," said Lampe. (With input from AP)
