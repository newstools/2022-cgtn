The Bank of Canada on Wednesday hiked its key lending rate by half a percentage point to 1.5 percent in an effort to throttle skyrocketing inflation. In a statement, the bank warned that inflation, largely driven by higher prices for energy and food, had topped the bank's forecast, reaching 6.8 percent in April and would "likely move even higher in the near term before beginning to ease."
