Former world No.1 Simona Halep met with the media on Sunday at the All England Club ahead of Wimbledon, a tournament she won back in 2019. The two-time grand slam champion is scheduled to face Czechia's Karolina Muchova on Tuesday in her opening match of the grand slam. "Every time I step on the court, I believe that I have my chance. So, I'm going to fight for it," she said. The 30-year-old Romanian withdrew ahead of her semifinal against 2019 U.S. Open winner Bianca Andreescu at the WTA's Bad Homburg Open with a neck injury on Friday. (With input from AP)
