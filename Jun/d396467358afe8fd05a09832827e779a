The request to impeach Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso failed to receive the necessary number of votes in the Ecuadorian National Assembly on Tuesday night, local media reported. Ninety-two votes were required to remove the president. Eighty-four assembly members voted in favor of the removal, 42 against, 11 abstained and none voted blank. The impeachment was initiated by opposition politicians for Lasso's role in "the serious political crisis and internal commotion" caused by the nationwide protests against rising fuel and living costs.
