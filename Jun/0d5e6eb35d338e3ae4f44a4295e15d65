Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Tuesday sent a congratulatory message to the International Forum on Trilateral Cooperation, where he called for further deepening cooperation with its two neighboring countries. The forum, hosted by the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat (TCS), serves as a trilateral cooperative framework among China, the Republic of Korea and Japan hoping to promote peace and common prosperity in the region. The three countries share wide common interests. Over the past 20 years, Beijing, Seoul and Tokyo have maintained practical cooperation and have preserved peace and development to East Asia, the Chinese diplomat said in the message. Under challenging international circumstances, Wang urged the three countries to step up political mutual trust and expand cooperation in maintaining vitality. He also stressed the need for strengthening people-to-people exchanges.
