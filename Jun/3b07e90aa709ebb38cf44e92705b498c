China granted licenses to 60 new video games, according to a list published on the website of the National Press and Public Administration (NPPA) on Tuesday. The move came after a nearly eight-month suspension of gaming approvals in the country. Games belonging to some well-known developers, such as Mihayou and Perfect World, are included on the list. However, the list did not contain games belonging to the industry's biggest players, such as Tencent and NetEase.
