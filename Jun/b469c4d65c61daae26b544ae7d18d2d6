Days of heavy rain in June have pushed the water level of the main stream of Beijiang River in south China's Guangdong Province above its warning level, inundating buildings and forcing mass evacuation in Yingde City. A woman was trapped in the car and called the police for help. Due to the flash floods, the police made six attempts to rescue the woman successfully.
