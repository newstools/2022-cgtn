Hong Kong is looking to renew its reputation as a major hub for art and cultural exchange. China's 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) says this is important for the country's economic and social development. Christie's Hong Kong sale room witnessed record-breaking sales, with 56 world auction records established across art and luxury categories in the Spring Auctions. It has also reflected popularity among 20th/21st century art and luxury goods. The sales saw strong participation from the Greater China Region. Francis Belin, President of Christie's Asia Pacific, says growth in the global art market has been sustained despite challenges from the pandemic on trade and monetary policy with Asia-Pacific collectors acquiring 30 percent of global offerings. CGTN reporter Cen Ziyuan spoke to the president of Christie's Asia-Pacific on how this was achieved.
