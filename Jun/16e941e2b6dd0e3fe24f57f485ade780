The Russian military shared footage on Wednesday showing high-precision long-range missiles being fired. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson said the high-precision Kalibr missiles destroyed an ammunition depot near the town of Zolochiv, close to the border with Poland. NATO-supplied weapons, as well as shells for M777 howitzers, were being stored there, according to the spokesperson. Ukrainian officials did not immediately comment on the attack in the western Lviv region.
