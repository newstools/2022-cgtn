One person was killed and 13 others injured following violent protests in India over a new army hiring plan. The Indian government had announced a temporary military recruitment plan this week. Under the new plan, the army would hire soldiers on a fixed four-year term and only 25 percent would be retained. Protesters said the plan would reduce their chances of getting permanent military jobs, which guarantee fixed salaries and pensions.
