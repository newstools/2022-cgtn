The world's first Suezmax LNG dual fuelled crude oil tanker was delivered in Guangzhou City, south China's Guangdong Province on Tuesday. Suezmax refers to the largest vessel navigable in the Suez Canal, with a deadweight tonnage (dwt) of about 150,000 tonnes. The 158,000-dwt vessel delivered can be powered by both LNG and crude oil. When it is propelled by LNG, the vessel can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent, nitrogen oxide emissions by 85 percent, and sulfur and particulate emissions by 99 percent. The vessel's main engine is supplied by a high-pressure system, with the internal gas line pressure equivalent to that of a column of 3,500 meters of water, to ensure full combustion of LNG, according to the ship's maker Guangzhou Shipyard International (GSI). It is also equipped with a gas treatment system, which can meet the most stringent emissions requirements in ports around the globe, added GSI. This is the first vessel built, and the second is under construction. With the delivery of this type of vessel, GSI can construct all kinds of oil tankers in the world, according to a report by China News Service.
