Kazakh voters have approved constitutional amendments that seek a new governance model in a nationwide referendum, according to the Central Election Commission. The constitutional reform, first announced by Kazakh President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev in March, moves to decentralize decision-making and allow greater representation of various groups in parliament.
