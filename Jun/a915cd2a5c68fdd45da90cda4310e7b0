Iga Swiatek powered into the French Open semifinals on Wednesday as a comfortable victory over American Jessica Pegula extended the world number one's winning streak to 33 matches. The Polish star cruised to a 6-3, 6-2 win on Court Philippe Chatrier to set up a last-four meeting with Daria Kasatkina on Thursday. Swiatek will equal Venus Williams' record for the longest unbeaten run for a women's player in the 21st century if she wins a second Roland Garros title this week. The top seed, who turned 21 on Tuesday, won her only Grand Slam title so far in Paris two years ago. She has won five consecutive tournaments this year, including four WTA 1,000 titles. Kasatkina reached her maiden Grand Slam semifinal with a 6-4, 7-6 (7/5) victory over fellow Russian Veronika Kudermetova. World number 20 Kasatkina, playing in her third career quarterfinal at the Slams but the first since 2018, has made the semis without dropping a set. On the men's court, Croatian Marin Cilic reached his first Grand Slam semi-final in four years by beating Russian seventh seed Andrey Rublev 5-7 6-3 6-4 3-6 7-6 (10-2) in a final super tiebreak. Cilic, who impressed in a straight-sets win against world number two Daniil Medvedev in the quarterfinals, again relied on his serve and huge forehand to make up for 71 unforced errors. The 2014 U.S. Open champion next faces Norwegian eighth seed Casper Ruud, as the 23-year-old outclassed teenage sensation Holger Rune of Denmark with a 6-1, 4-6, 7-6(2), 6-3 victory in the first all-Scandinavian quarterfinal.
