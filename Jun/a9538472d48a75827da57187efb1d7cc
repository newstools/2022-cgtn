The International University Sports Federation (FISU) announced on Friday that the Chengdu 2021 World University Games (Universiade) will take place from July 28 to August 8, 2023. The 31st-edition FISU Summer Universiade had initially been scheduled for the summer of 2021, but was delayed to June 2022 following the postponement of the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games. The FISU said the age limit and eligibility will be adapted to allow the participation of students who had been eligible for the postponed 2021 and 2022 editions. Chengdu will be the third Chinese city to host the Summer Universiade, after Beijing in 2001 and Shenzhen in 2011. "Twenty percent of the world's university students are in China, and the national university sports federation has a clear and proven capability of holding student sports events of the very highest quality, even at relatively short notice," FISU President Oleg Matytsin said in a statement posted on fisu.net. "We have no doubt that the Chengdu Universiade will prove to be an exceptional World University Games host that will make a lasting and very positive impression both on the participants and on the city itself," he added.
