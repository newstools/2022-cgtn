The death toll from an explosion in a coal mine in northeastern Colombia on Monday has risen to seven, and eight workers remain unaccounted for, the National Mining Agency (ANM) said on Saturday, according to AFP. Officials said a buildup of gases led to a fire, explosion, and then the collapse of nearly 90 percent of the mine in the town of El Zulia, near the border with Venezuela. Some 70 rescuers were continuing the search for victims.
