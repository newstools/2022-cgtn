China on Tuesday urged the United States to strictly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques and cease any form of official exchange with China's Taiwan region. According to media reports, the U.S. and the Taiwan region held discussions on the so-called "Initiative on 21st-Century Trade" on Monday. Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a regular press briefing that China firmly opposes all forms of official interaction with the Taiwan region by countries that have diplomatic ties with China, including negotiating or concluding agreements with implications of sovereignty and of an official nature. "There is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government representing the whole of China," Zhao reiterated. The U.S. must abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations in the three China-U.S. joint communiques with concrete action, he said. Zhao urged the U.S. to stop the negotiation or conclusion of agreements with implications of sovereignty and of an official nature with the Taiwan region and refrain from sending any wrong signal to the "Taiwan independence" separatist forces. The Democratic Progressive Party authorities should give up on the idea that they could seek "Taiwan independence" with U.S. support at once, he said. "The more ambitious they are, the bitterer their failure will be." (Cover: The Taipei 101 skyscraper in Taipei, southeast China's Taiwan. /CFP)
