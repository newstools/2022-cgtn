The Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA) has been stepping up its efforts to develop its high-tech sector. Many companies say they chose the GBA to start their business due to the strong policy support and enabling high-tech environment. Ma Chi, the CEO of Bone's Technology, mentioned that "the Hong Kong science park gave us a lot of support to advise us on how to build the market and product and how to make the product market expansion in the mainland." And after the company's headquarters moved to Qinghai in Shenzhen, "we also have a lot of financial support, like we enjoy 40 percent discount on the rent."
