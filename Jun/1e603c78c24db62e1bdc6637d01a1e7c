A new round of talks on the revival of the 2015 nuclear deal is very likely to be held in Qatar's capital Doha, Iran's Nournews reported Sunday. The news outlet, affiliated with the country's Supreme National Security Council, tweeted that Qatar stands a "better chance of hosting the forthcoming talks" because of its "ongoing efforts to resume talks on lifting sanctions." The talks have been suspended since March when it was believed to be only a step away from a final agreement, raising deep concerns about their prospect.
