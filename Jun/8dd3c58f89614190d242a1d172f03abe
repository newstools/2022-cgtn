Two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova charged past defending champion and No.8 seed Jelena Ostapenko 6-3, 6-2 on Saturday to win the Rothesay International in Eastbourne for the 29th WTA singles title of her career. "I am very delighted, of course, after a special final. I knew that Jelena is playing well here on grass (and is the) defending champion. So, I was really prepared for the fast, aggressive game which she played. It was a good match from both of us," Kvitova said after the match. Kvitova, the Wimbledon champion in 2011 and 2014, is now 5-1 in the grass-court finals. The former world No.2 won the first of her 29 titles in 2009. From then on, the only player to win more singles titles on tour is American great Serena Williams, with 41 titles during that 13-year timeframe. The 32-year-old becomes the fifth player over the age of 30 to win a title this year, joining Simona Halep (Melbourne Summer Set 1), Angelique Kerber (Strasbourg), Tatjana Maria (Bogota) and Zhang Shuai (Lyon). Kvitova will start her 2022 campaign at SW19 against Italy's Jasmine Paolini on Tuesday. The Czech won both of her previous matches in straight sets at the 2020 Roland Garros and last year's Olympics. Meanwhile, Caroline Garcia won her first tour title in three years after coming back from a set and a break down to beat 2019 U.S. Open champion Bianca Andreescu 6-7 (5), 6-4, 6-4 on Saturday in the final of the Bad Homburg Open. Garcia now owns three grass-court singles titles, having previously triumphed in Mallorca in 2016 and Nottingham in 2019. Both women now turn their attention to Wimbledon, where the former world No.4 Garcia will play her first-round match against British wildcard Yuriko Miyazaki on Monday. The Canadian opens against American qualifier Emina Bektas on Tuesday. (With input from WTA officials)
