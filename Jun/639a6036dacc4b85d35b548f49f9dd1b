British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Tuesday she expects the first flight of asylum seekers to Rwanda to depart from the UK today, but she couldn't specify how many would be on board. "Our policy is completely legal and completely moral," Truss said, adding that critics of the her government's Rwanda deportation plan need to "suggest an alternative policy that will work."
