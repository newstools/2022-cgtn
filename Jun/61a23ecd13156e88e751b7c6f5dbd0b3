China has called for the removal of all U.S. tariffs against China in the interest of businesses and consumers amid high global inflation, which is good for both countries, said Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Shu Jueting on Thursday. Shu made the remarks in response to U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo’s comments that the Biden administration has decided to keep some tariffs on steel and aluminum in place to protect American workers and the steel industry.
