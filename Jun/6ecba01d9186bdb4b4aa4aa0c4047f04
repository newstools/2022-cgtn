The rain didn't deter racegoers from pulling out all the stops for the final day of horse racing extravaganza Royal Ascot on Saturday. Day five of the glamorous event saw ladies turn heads in outlandish hats and fashion choices. Feathers, pompoms, and even a miniature horse were among the embellishments on Saturday's headwear. The Queen's cousin Prince Edward, Duke of Kent, joined her granddaughter Princess Beatrice as the five-day event draws to a close. Earlier in the week, Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Princess Anne were among members of the royal family to attend the horse racing event. However, Queen Elizabeth II has missed Royal Ascot this year due to her ongoing mobility issues. Her Majesty is a horse racing enthusiast and has been at every Royal Meeting at Ascot since becoming queen in 1952, apart from in 2020 when it was held behind closed doors due to the pandemic. Meanwhile, 70 children were also present during the royal procession on Saturday, paying tribute to the Queen in her platinum jubilee year. (With input from AP)
