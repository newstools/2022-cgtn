Terrorists have killed at least 23 men in Nigeria's northeast Borno state in the latest violence to hit the conflict-ridden region, militia sources were quoted as saying by AFP on Thursday. Fighters from the Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) seized the men on Tuesday as they searched for scrap metal as part of a 50-strong group in the Magdala village in the Dikwa district, they said.
