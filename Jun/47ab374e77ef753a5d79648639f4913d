Hawaii photographer Clark Little is known for his stunning images from inside the barrels of some of the most powerful and dangerous waves on Earth. The Oahu native just released a new book that chronicles his last 15 years of getting slammed in the surf while capturing the beauty of the ocean. "Shore break is so beautiful and scary at the same time," Little said of the waves that crash directly onto the sand. "I used to surf the shore break, so ... it's my comfort zone. I like sand bottom. I think it has more aqua beautiful colors." The new book, "The Art of Waves," was published by Penguin Random House and has more than 150 of his favorite images. (With input from AP)
