Unidentified perpetrators kidnapped and killed eight people in the state of Yucatan in southern Mexico, local media reported on Saturday. The bodies were found by a farmer in a field in a Yucatan village just over the border from Quintana Roo. Yucatan prosecutors said they were probably just dumped there.
