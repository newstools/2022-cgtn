The World Bank slashed the 2022 global growth forecast to 2.9 percent on Tuesday, 1.2 percentage points below the January forecast. The Russia-Ukraine conflict and COVID-19 pandemic have magnified the slowdown in the global economy, which is now entering what could become "a protracted period of feeble growth and elevated inflation," the World Bank said in its Global Economic Prospects report. The World Bank also warned of the risk of stagflation, with potentially harmful consequences for middle- and low-income economies alike.
