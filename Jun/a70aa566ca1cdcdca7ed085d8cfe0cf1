China released major issues in science, engineering technology and industrial technology for 2022 at the closing ceremony of the 24th Annual Meeting of the China Association for Science and Technology (CAST) in Changsha City, central China's Hunan Province on Monday. A total of 30 issues, including the early diagnosis of asymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, the formation and evolution of black holes in the universe, the application of remote sensing to effectively assess the Earth's health and the industrialization of memory computation integrated chips, were highlighted during the closing ceremony. Since the launch of an information solicitation campaign at the end of January this year, the CAST has received 649 proposals for sci-tech issues in 10 fields, namely, basic science, Earth science, ecological environment, manufacturing technology, information technology, advanced materials, resources and energy, agricultural science and technology, life health, and aerospace science and technology. More than 30,000 sci-tech professionals submitted recommendations and helped to evaluate the issues. CAST has collected major scientific and technological issues for five consecutive years, starting in 2018. So far, 2,772 proposals have been collected, and 160 have been released.
