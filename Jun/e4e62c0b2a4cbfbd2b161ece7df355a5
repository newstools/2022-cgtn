Chinese President Xi Jinping has emphasized unswerving adherence to China's path of human rights development, saying that whether human rights are upheld in a country cannot be judged by the criteria of others. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, made the remarks in an article on China's human rights development. The article by Xi will be published Thursday in this year's 12th issue of the Qiushi Journal, a flagship magazine of the CPC Central Committee. Since the 18th CPC National Congress in 2012, the CPC has continued to make the respect for and protection of human rights an important agenda of national governance, and has prompted historic achievements in China's human rights cause, Xi said.In the practice of advancing the cause of human rights, China has blazed a path of human rights development that is consistent with the trend of the times and suits the nation's conditions, he stressed, adding that the affinity to the people is the most significant feature of China's path to human rights development.He also noted six main features of China's development of human rights: upholding the Party's leadership, respecting the people's principal position, proceeding from national realities, upholding the rights to subsistence and development as the primary and basic human rights, safeguarding human rights in accordance with the law, and participating in global governance on human rights.
