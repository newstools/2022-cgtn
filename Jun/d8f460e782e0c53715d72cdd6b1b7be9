The head of Tunisia's constitution committee, Sadok Belaid, delivered the draft of a new constitution to President Kais Saied on Monday, the presidency said, with expectations that the document will grant more powers to the president. The president intends to put the new constitution to a referendum on July 25, though the opposition has said it will boycott the plebiscite. Thousands of Tunisians protested against the referendum in the capital over the weekend.
