The Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) on Friday monitored a U.S. military aircraft's flight over the Taiwan Straits, and vowed to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity. The U.S. sent a P-8A anti-submarine patrol aircraft over the Taiwan Straits on Friday and publicly hyped the move, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the PLA Eastern Theater Command, said in a statement on Saturday. He said the PLA Eastern Theater Command had dispatched aerial and ground forces to follow and monitor the flight on high alert. Shi criticized the U.S. move, saying it intentionally disrupted the regional situation and endangered cross-Strait peace and stability. "We firmly oppose it," he added. The theater command will maintain high alert to safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, the spokesperson added.
