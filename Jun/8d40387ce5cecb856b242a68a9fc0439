At the 90th edition of the 24 Hours of Le Mans on June 11/12, the Hollywood actor and Porsche driver Michael Fassbender will make his long-awaited debut at the legendary endurance classic. For the last three years, the 45-year-old Irish-German, famous for his blockbuster films such as "Inglourious Basterds" and "X-Men," has prepared intensively and single-mindedly for the highlight of his motor racing career. The 45-year-old shared: "It's always been a dream of mine to contest the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and the thing with dreams is you don't think about how much work you've invested or how many setbacks you've had to face." Fassbender is not the first actor to attempt the driving challenge, with actors Paul Newman and Patrick Dempsey also having given Le Mans a go previously. (With input from AP)
