The 15 billion yuan ($2.2 billion) investment shows strong confidence in the future of the Chinese market, Franz Decker, CEO of BMW Brilliance Group, told CGTN in an interview, referring to the company's new factory which opened on Thursday in Shenyang, northeast China's Liaoning Province. The new Lydia plant of BMW Brilliance, a joint venture between BMW and Chinese carmaker Brilliance China Automotive Holdings Ltd., will boost BMW's annual output in China to 830,000 vehicles, the automaker said. It is the biggest single investment of the German automaker in China. Although there were some disruptions caused by COVID outbreaks since late March, Decker said they are well prepared for the second half year and they are glad about China's stimulus measures and support for the market. With the stimulus, such as purchase tax reduction, "I believe we will see a very prosperous and very successful second half year," he said. The plant is covered with a gigabit 5G network to meet the bandwidth requirements for technologies like augmented reality and real-time video transmission. Shenyang is BMW Group's largest production base worldwide. The total number of the group's employees in China exceeds 28,000. (With input from Xinhua)
