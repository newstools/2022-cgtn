A Chinese envoy on Wednesday called on the European Union to create conditions for talks between relevant parties in the Russia-Ukraine conflict and facilitate the restoration of peace, so as to ease the plight of women and children. Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, made the remarks during a UN Security Council open debate on women, peace and security, stressing that achieving peace is the best protection for women. "We support the UN in coordinating actions with the EU and countries in the region to ensure the safety of life and property of Ukrainian citizens, including women and children, to meet their basic humanitarian needs, and to effectively crack down on the human trafficking, sexual exploitation and abuse of women and children refugees," Dai said. He called on the international community to "keep to the fundamental direction of political settlement, work to eliminate the root causes of conflict, and step up efforts to promote peace." Dai stressed that the advancement of women's cause is inseparable from a stable political environment. He also called on the UN and other regional organizations to give priority to development and help more women "achieve economic autonomy." (With input from Xinhua)
