Ferrari's Charles Leclerc won his sixth pole position of the 2022 season for the Formula 1 Azerbaijan Grand Prix on Saturday. Ferrari's biggest rivals for pole positions this year, Red Bull racers Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen, finished 2nd and 3rd. This was the sixth time in eight races this season the two teams have locked out the front two rows. Leclerc is currently nine points short of leader Verstappen, who took his first championship title last year in a dramatic season finale in the Abu Dhabi GP. However, it is his teammate Perez, the winner in Monaco two weeks ago, who would be sharing the front row in Baku with Leclerc. Perez now sits third on the tally six points behind Leclerc. Seven-time world champion Lewis Hamilton of Mercedes will start from P7, which means he has not had any top-four start this season. Zhou Guanyu of China, racing for Alfa Romeo, will start from P14, as he out-qualified teammate Valtteri Bottas for the first time. (With input from Reuters)
