Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Monday named his finance minister and potential successor Lawrence Wong as the country’s new deputy prime minister, effective next week. Wong, 49, was chosen as leader of the ruling People's Action Party's (PAP) so-called fourth generation team in April, paving the way for him to become prime minister in the future. Wong will continue in his current role of finance minister while serving as deputy prime minister, according to an official statement.
