Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said on Tuesday that the federal government had formed a committee to negotiate with Tigray forces. "Regarding the peace, a committee has been established. Negotiation needs a lot of work. A committee has been established, and it will study on how we will conduct talks," Abiy told lawmakers in parliament. The Ethiopian government announced what it called an "indefinite humanitarian truce" in its war-ravaged Tigray region in March this year, saying the action was necessary to allow unimpeded relief supplies into the area.
