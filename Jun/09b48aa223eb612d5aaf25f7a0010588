Ecuador's President Guillermo Lasso on Saturday lifted the state of emergency that was being enforced in the six provinces most affected by Indigenous protests against his government, according to a decree issued by the presidential headquarters. Ecuador's National Assembly began a no-confidence hearing for the president on Saturday. Opposition lawmakers called the parliamentary session over what they say is Lasso's role in "the serious political crisis and internal commotion" that has left six civilians dead and dozens injured on both sides in 13 days of revolt.
