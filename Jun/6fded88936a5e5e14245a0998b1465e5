British Prime Minister Boris Johnson will face a confidence vote on Monday, Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs (Members of Parliament), has confirmed. "The threshold of 15 percent of the parliamentary party seeking a vote of confidence in the leader of the Conservative Party has been exceeded," Brady wrote in a note. In accordance with the rules, the vote will be held between 6 p.m. and 8 p.m. (1700-1900 GMT) on Monday, Brady said. "The votes will be counted immediately afterward. An announcement will be made at a time to be advised," he added. Johnson, appointed prime minister in 2019, has been under growing pressure, unable to move on from a report that documented alcohol-fuelled parties at the heart of power while the UK was under strict lockdown restrictions to tackle COVID-19. Jesse Norman, a loyalist who served as a junior minister in the finance ministry between 2019 and 2021, said the prime minister staying in power insulted both the electorate and the party. He is just one of several Conservative lawmakers who have voiced concern over whether Johnson, 57, has lost his authority to govern Britain, which is facing the risk of recession, rising prices and strike-inflicted travel chaos in the capital London. A spokesperson for Johnson's Downing Street office said the vote was "a chance to end months of speculation and allow the government to draw a line and move on, delivering on the people's priorities". "The PM welcomes the opportunity to make his case to MPs and will remind them that when they're united and focused on the issues that matter to voters there is no more formidable political force."
