U.S. President Joe Biden signed a bipartisan gun control bill into law on Saturday, thereby enacting the most sweeping legislation designed to prevent gun violence in nearly 30 years. The legislation takes effect a month after a gunman broke into an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, killing 19 children and two teachers in a rampage that has triggered nationwide demonstrations against gun violence and political inaction. "I know there's much more to do," Biden said from the White House before leaving for a trip to Europe. The U.S. House gave final approval of the bipartisan bill Friday, following Senate passage on Thursday. Meanwhile, the U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday declared for the first time that the U.S. Constitution protected an individual's right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense.
