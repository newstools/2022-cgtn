New Burnley manager Vincent Kompany said on Friday that he is settling in well at Turf Moor and looking forward to tackling the squad rebuilding process at the club. Burnley have lost a series of players following their relegation from the Premier League last season, including Ben Mee, James Tarkowski and Nick Pope. "It goes with a potential drop in revenues when you fall out of the Premier League," he said. "You have to expect players to move on, but we still have some experienced players and a depth of quality, and we are looking forward to bringing in some exciting players." (With input from AP)
