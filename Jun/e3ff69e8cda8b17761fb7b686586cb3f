Eight medical personnel who treated Diego Maradona in the weeks before his death in November 2020 will stand trial for culpable homicide. A judge in Argentina has ordered a trial following an investigation into Maradona's death from cardiac arrest. The report found his treatment in the final weeks of his life was rife with, "deficiencies and irregularities". The report also claimed Maradona, "would have had a better chance of survival" if he received adequate treatment in an appropriate medical facility. Among the staff facing charges are Maradona's personal doctor, Leopoldo Luque, who has denied responsibility for his death. During the treatments in Buenos Aires in late 2020, Luque once said outside the hospital that the football legend was in good condition, "The surgery was performed by a selected team of several renowned neurosurgeons. It lasted approximately one hour 20 minutes. We managed to remove the chronic subdural hematoma successfully. Diego coped very well with the surgery. Diego is awake, Diego is very well." Culpable homicide is a charge of taking a life without intent, and if found guilty, the medical personnel could face up to 25 years in prison. A date for the trial is yet to be set.
