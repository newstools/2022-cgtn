The Bank of Japan on Friday announced it would maintain an ultralow rate policy. At a two-day policy-setting meeting, the Japanese central bank set short-term interest rates at -0.1 percent while allowing 10-year Japanese government bond yields to move at around zero percent. The central bank also said it would offer to buy unlimited amounts of 10-year Japanese government bonds (JGB) at 0.25 percent every business day, in accordance with the guidance on market operations it issued in April.
