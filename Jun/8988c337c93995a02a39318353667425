China is ready to strengthen exchanges and mutual learning with Latin America and contribute more wisdom and strength to the sustainable development of both sides, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday. Wang made the pledge when he delivered a video speech to the 24th General Assembly of the Latin American Academy of Social Sciences, a regional intergovernmental organization initiated by UNESCO and one of the three major social science teaching and research institutions in the region. "Today, China officially became an observer country of the Latin American Academy of Social Sciences," he said, adding that his country attaches great importance to cooperation with the organization. Wang said China is willing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation with the Latin American Academy of Social Sciences, strengthen exchanges and mutual learning between China and Latin America, and contribute more wisdom and strength to the sustainable development of China and Latin America. Facing the changes and a pandemic both unseen in a century, China and Latin American and Caribbean countries have supported each other and worked together to overcome difficulties, bringing China-Latin America relations characterized by equality, mutual benefit, innovation, opening-up, and benefit for the people into a new era, he said. China is ready to work with Latin American and Caribbean countries to jointly safeguard peace and stability, promote economic recovery, improve people's well-being and advance the joint building of a China-Latin America community with a shared future, Wang said. The assembly, held in Ecuador, voted to admit China as an observer state.
