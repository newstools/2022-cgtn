China released its line-up for the Women's Volleyball Nations League on Tuesday. Outside hitter Li Yingying, captain Yuan Xinyue, opposite Gong Xiangyu and setter Ding Xia are among the big names on the squad that will face the Netherlands in their opening match in Ankara, Turkey. According to head coach Cai Bin, China adjusted well after arriving in the Turkish capital, despite suffering from travel exhaustion and jet lag. The team resumed regular training sessions on Monday. "We are eager to see how the side shapes up after the Tokyo Olympics, based on changes to the line-up, especially in certain tough battles," Cai said. "We'll also try to locate problems and find ways to improve in all aspects. And in that sense, competitive matches are the best test for the team." Young talents who performed well in China's domestic league, such as outside hitter Wang Yizhu, setter Diao Lingyu and libero Ni Feifan, add vitality to the squad. Others expected to contribute to the team's efforts include spikers Jin Ye and Wang Yunlu, and middle blockers Yang Hanyu, Gao Yi and Zheng Yixin. Miu Yiwen, Cai Yaqian and Wang Weiyi were also on the final roster. "On one hand, we need to provide inexperienced young players chances to grow, but on the other hand, we have to get a good result at the VNL. I need to balance it," Cai said ahead of the trip to Turkey. He confirmed the side's goal is to reach the final. Following Wednesday's opening match against the Dutch, the Chinese squad will face Pool 2 hosts Turkey on Friday, European champions Italy on Saturday and Asian rivals Thailand on Sunday.
