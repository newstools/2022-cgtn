Speaking ahead of the tournament on Sunday, Australian tennis player Nick Kyrgios expressed his disappointment with Wimbledon's decision to ban Russian and Belarusian players. "I mean, my honest opinion, I don't think it was a good idea to ban the Russian players to play. I think Medvedev is the best we have in our sport right now. You look at some of their other players – Rublev, Khachanov – they're important young players for our sport to continue to grow," the 27-year-old said. "I'm disappointed they're not here. It's weird not seeing Medvedev here. We all know what he's capable of. But look, it's done now. I'm sure that they're going to be tuning in and watching, wishing they were here," he added.
