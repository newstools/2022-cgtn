Elon Musk's SpaceX launched its reusable Falcon 9 rocket early Sunday morning, sending a single replacement satellite for communications operator Globalstar into orbit. A two-stage Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 12:27 a.m. EDT (0427 GMT). Ten minutes after liftoff, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth, performing a vertical landing. It's the third SpaceX mission in just over 36 hours. The company launched 53 of its Starlink internet satellites on Friday from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida and sent a German radar satellite from California's Vandenberg Space Force Base on Saturday.
