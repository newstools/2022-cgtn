Aurelien Tchouameni, who departed Ligue 1's Monaco for La Liga's Real Madrid in an 80-million-euro (about $83.4 million) transfer last week, revealed that Kylian Mbappe tried to persuade him to join French powerhouse Paris Saint-Germain (PSG). Before Tchouameni's deal was confirmed, Real competed with both PSG and Premier League's Liverpool to acquire the 22-year-old French midfielder. Moreover, Mbappe rejected Real's offer in May and signed a three-year extension with PSG after over two years of transfer rumors of him arriving at Estadio Santiago Bernabeu. "Kylian decided to stay at PSG, and he knew I was leaving Monaco," Tchouameni said at his presentation as a Real member on Tuesday. "He wanted to know if I would join him at PSG. But my first choice was Real Madrid, and he understood that completely." As the interceptions leader (101) of Ligue 1 this season, Tchouameni also had 86 tackles, the fourth-most among all players in the French top football league. His performance drew interest from Real, PSG and Liverpool, but he said he always wanted to join Real. "I had the chance to choose other teams, but once I knew Real Madrid were interested, I did not have a single doubt," Tchouameni said. "I spoke with other clubs, but in my head, I was always waiting for Madrid. I spoke with my agent, my family and [Monaco] to find the best agreement for everyone." "Madrid are the biggest club in the world, they have a team with incredible players, and I think it's the best decision for me," he added. Having signed a six-year contract with Real, Tchouameni will wear the No. 18 jersey of Gareth Bale. He, Federico Valverde and Eduardo Camavinga are seen as the future midfield spine of the club. "He (Tchouameni) is one of the best midfielders in the world. Today he arrives at Real Madrid. At 22 years old, he was able to choose his club and he chose this one," Real president Florentino Perez said at the presentation.
