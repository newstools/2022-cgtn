Albanian lawmakers elected Bajram Begaj, who previously held the post of chief of general staff of the armed forces, as the new president of the southeastern European country at a parliament session on Saturday. The parliament had failed to elect a new president in the first three rounds as no candidates were proposed by any of the parliamentary groups. According to the country's constitution, a total of 84 votes in favor are needed to elect a proposed candidate as president in the first three rounds and 71 votes in fourth and fifth rounds. Eighty-three lawmakers voted in Saturday's fourth round, and Begaj was elected with a simple majority with the support of the ruling Socialist Party of Prime Minister Edi Rama. The majority of the opposition boycotted the process. The role of president is largely symbolic, though it has some powers over the judiciary and the military. Begaj, 55, will take the oath as the new president on July 25, 2022 to replace Ilir Meta, who will be in office until July 22, 2022.
