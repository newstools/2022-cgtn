U.S. President Joe Biden will travel to Schloss Elmau in southern Germany on June 25 to attend the G7 Leaders' Summit, the White House announced on Wednesday. The Russia-Ukraine conflict will top the agenda, along with the issues of climate crisis, development infrastructure, global health security, and the food and energy crisis, said the statement. On June 28, Biden will travel to Madrid, Spain for the 2022 NATO Summit. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said in May that NATO Summit in Madrid will be a "historic" opportunity to strengthen the defense alliance. He looked forward to welcoming Sweden and Finland at the summit who have submitted their applications to join NATO.
