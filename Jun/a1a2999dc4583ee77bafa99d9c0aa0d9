The 27 member states of the European Union (EU) announced early Wednesday the Commission's plan to ban the sale of vehicles with combustion engines by 2035 in Europe, in a bid to reduce CO2 emissions to zero. At the request of a few countries, including Germany and Italy, all the member states also agreed to consider a possible green light in the future for the use of alternative technologies such as synthetic fuels or plug-in hybrids.
