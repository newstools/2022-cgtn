Ukraine's chief negotiator said that peace talks with Russia may resume at the end of August. The Kremlin has claimed willingness on their side but said Kyiv has been "out of touch" since April. What's the possibility that peace talks will actually happen and both sides come to an agreement? Rong Ying, vice president of the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, said that humanitarian, energy and food crises have made all parties realize that peace talks are the only way to solve the conflict. However, when they will take place remains unknown.
