Local herdsmen in Ar Horqin Banner, north China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, have been busy transferring around 170,000 heads of livestock from a winter pasture to a summer one recently. The journey began on June 15, and took about a week to arrive. Local authorities have set up many service stations along the route to provide help to the herders. "We've been providing the herders with various services such as food, medical care, rescue and security. When the herdsman's vehicles break down, we rush to help them as quickly as we could," said Chaganbala, a volunteer service member.
