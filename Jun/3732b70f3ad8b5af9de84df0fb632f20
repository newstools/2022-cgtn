China's top-ranked Zhang Shuai swept homegrown player Jodie Burrage 6-2, 7-6 (4) in 84 minutes to reach the quarterfinals at the Nottingham Open on Wednesday. Burrage had ousted another Chinese player Zhu Lin in the first round. Fourth-seeded Zhang, a former runner-up at the event, will next face Tereza Martincova of the Czech Republic, who beat Pole Magda Linette 6-2, 7-6 (3) to advance. "I am really happy to make another victory in the singles match. It gave me great confidence in grass-court tournament," said Zhang, ranked 41 in the world. "I am so glad to be back in Nottingham. Last year, I had a good performance from here, and now I keep my singles and doubles rankings as well. It means that my efforts paid off, and I've made some progress. I am proud of myself." The match involving Zhang and Beatriz Haddad Maia, ranked fourth in the doubles, was postponed due to rain on Wednesday. In another ongoing WTA event in Valencia, Chinese young player Wang Xiyu came from behind to beat Rebeka Masarova 4-6, 7-5, 7-5 in an intense game to reach the last eight. Chinese teenage rising star Zheng Qinwen partnered with French Diane Parry in the doubles but lost to top-seeded Irina Bara and Ekaterine Gorgodze 6-0, 6-4 in the first round.
