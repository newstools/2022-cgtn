China sent a new Earth observation satellite into space from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China on Monday. The satellite, Gaofen-12 03, was launched by a Long March-4C carrier rocket at 11:46 p.m. and entered the planned orbit successfully. It will be used in a variety of fields, including land surveys, urban planning, road network design, crop yield estimation, and disaster relief. The launch marked the 425th mission of the Long March series of carrier rockets.
