Born and raised in Hong Kong, Chung Gaai-lam has a deep connection with the mainland. After graduating from middle school, he chose to study at Peking University. After graduation, he decided to settle down with his wife in Shenzhen and practice law. China emphasizes the rule of law, so the legal profession in Shenzhen has great prospects, said Chung. He hopes that Hong Kong and Shenzhen can integrate more and jointly build the world-famous Greater Bay Area.
