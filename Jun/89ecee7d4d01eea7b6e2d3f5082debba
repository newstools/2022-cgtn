U.S. President Joe Biden extended the country's sanctions against representatives of the Belarusian leadership by one year on Monday, according to the White House. "The actions and policies of certain members of the Government of Belarus and other persons, and the Belarusian regime’s harmful activities and long-standing abuses, continue to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States," the White House said.
