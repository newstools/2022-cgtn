Leung Chun-ying, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top political advisory body, as well as former chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), says Hong Kong's democracy, along with its high level of autonomy, is spelled out clearly in the HKSAR's Basic Law and is as unique as the "One Country, Two Systems" principle. He made the statement in an interview with CGTN.
