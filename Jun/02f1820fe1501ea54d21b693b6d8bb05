The U.S. federal government will fund New Mexico's full wildfire response, President Joe Biden said on Saturday in Santa Fe, amid anger from survivors over the blaze that was started by federal officials. "We have a responsibility to help the state recover," Biden told elected officials and emergency responders at an afternoon briefing in the state capital, where he was reviewing efforts to fight the state's biggest blaze in recorded history.
