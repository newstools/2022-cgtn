Friday marks the Dragon Boat Festival, also known as Duanwu Festival in China. In Taiyuan Ancient County, north China’s Shanxi Province, children are learning to make zongzi, a traditional snack made with glutinous rice and delicious fillings. Some children are also learning to braid ropes of five different colors, which they wear on their wrist to keep out evil during the festival. Others are playing touwudu, a game where one throws sandbags to hit five boards, each bearing the image of an animal. These events are especially designed for children and will be held until Sunday.
