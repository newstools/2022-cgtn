The 9th Summit of the Americas has opened in Los Angeles on June 6. Only 32 of the 35 heads of state that make up the Organization of American States were invited by U.S. President Joe Biden. Some Latin American leaders rejected their invitation to the summit because not all countries were invited. Some of the ties that the summit is meant to bring together are being tested, as the U.S. excluded Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela.
