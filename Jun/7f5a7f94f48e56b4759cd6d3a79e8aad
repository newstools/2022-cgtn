The European Union has approved a new round of sanctions against Russia. Leaders agreed to ban more than two-thirds of Russian oil imports, with Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic secured from exemptions due to the pipeline imports they rely on. The embargo on crude oil imports will take full effect by the end of this year. This latest round of sanctions also includes cutting Russia's biggest bank Sberbank off from the SWIFT international transaction system.
