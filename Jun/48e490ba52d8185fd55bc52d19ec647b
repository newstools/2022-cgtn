Voting in Kazakhstan's constitutional referendum will take place between 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. local time on Sunday at more than 10,000 polling stations nationwide. The newly-proposed constitutional reforms, first announced by President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev during his State of the Nation Address in March, are said to transform Kazakhstan from a super-presidential system to a "presidential system with a strong parliament."
