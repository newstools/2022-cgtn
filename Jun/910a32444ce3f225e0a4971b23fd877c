The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed by a vote of 221-204 the Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act, which will help address supply chain risks and lower the cost of food and gas prices. It will also remove summertime restrictions on the sale of gasoline that uses a 15-percent ethanol blend and appropriate $200 million to expand biofuel infrastructure and equipment.
