Yellowstone National Park announced on Monday that all entrances are temporarily closed due to heavy flooding and rockslides, extremely hazardous conditions caused by unprecedented rainfall recently. Officials say they won't be able to say when the park might reopen until the flood waters subside and they can assess the damage.
