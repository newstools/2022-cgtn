The 22 teams competing in this year's Tour de France were officially presented to fans in Denmark on Wednesday ahead of the race's Grand Depart - Friday's individual time trial in Copenhagen. Slovenia's Tadej Pogacar is targetting a third successive overall victory in the world's biggest cycling event, which would seal his position as a Tour de France great. Pogacar, speaking in front of thousands of fans cheering them ahead of the race this year at Tivoli Gardens, said, "That's why we have such a nice group. We have fun every day, every moment of our days, in the bus, in the training and in the race. And yeah, I think we're going to smile until the end, no matter what." The main threat to Pogacar's hat-trick hopes could be his compatriot Primoz Roglic of Jumbo-Visma, who finished as runner-up in 2022. Roglic's Danish team-mate Jonas Vingegaard, who received a stirring welcome on Wednesday, will also be targetting the yellow jersey after finishing second to Pogacar in last year's race.
