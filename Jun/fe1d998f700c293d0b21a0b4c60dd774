China's annual power generation from renewable energy sources will reach 3.3 trillion kWh by 2025 amid efforts to achieve carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, according to a plan for the 2021-2025 period unveiled Wednesday. The plan, jointly released by nine Chinese government organs, including the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), states that power generation through renewable energy sources during the country's 14th Five-Year Plan period (2021-2025) will account for over half of total electricity consumption, equivalent to saving 1 billion tonnes of standard coal by 2025. It also outlines developmental strategies for renewables like wind, solar, biomass and geothermal energy, and for promoting the use of green hydrogen in sectors such as chemical production, coal mining and transportation. In addition, China will expedite the construction of storage facilities and upgrade its power grids to feature intelligent functions, thereby facilitating clean energy development.
