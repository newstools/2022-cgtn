China has been playing a constructive role in promoting peace talks and has not provided military assistance to any conflicting parties, the Chinese Embassy in the U.S. told Global Times on Wednesday, in response to the U.S. adding five Chinese firms to a trade blacklist for allegedly supporting Russia's military. China has always been firmly opposed to the unilateral sanctions and so-called "long-arm jurisdiction" imposed by the U.S., and China will take all necessary measures to safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of its companies, the embassy said.
