The European Commission on Tuesday said it had signed a deal with Danish biotech firm Bavarian Nordic for about 110,000 doses of monkeypox vaccine. The agreement marks the first time that the EU budget is being used for the direct purchase of vaccines and would make the shots rapidly available to all EU member states, Norway and Iceland, the commission said.
