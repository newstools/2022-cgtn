Wicket-keeper batsman Rishab Pant has been promoted as the captain of India for the five-match T20 series against South Africa after the stand-in captain KL Rahul suffered a groin injury and was ruled out of the series on Wednesday. Pant was pleased that just like his idol, MS Dhoni, he too has gotten an opportunity to lead the Indian team. On his appointment, Pant said, "I will try to make the most of it. But first of all, thanks to all my well-wishers throughout my journey, for supporting me through my thick and thin of my cricketing career. But I would like to make this as a base and keep improving and keep making my life better and better each and every day." Meanwhile, all-rounder Hardik Pandya has been named as the vice-captain for the series. "I haven't thought about it," Pant said on Pandya's appointment as vice-captain, "Yes, he's (Hardik Pandya) won a title-ship (winning the IPL title), like a champion. It's a big thing for us. So, I'll try to grab as many positives from him and try to learn from him also." (With input from AP)
