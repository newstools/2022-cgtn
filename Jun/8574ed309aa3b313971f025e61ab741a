China's time-honored Dragon Boat Festival falls on June 3 this year. Qingyang City in northwest China's Gansu Province has a dazzling array of sachets for the festivity. Qingyang sachet is one of China's intangible cultural heritages. With the efforts of the heritage inheritors, the handicrafts have been re-designed into portable ones and smaller accessories, gaining popularity among younger Chinese. The rise of e-commerce has also brought new opportunities to China's folk culture.
