China and Japan should adhere to win-win cooperation and enhance mutual trust in security to bring a stable, healthy and resilient Sino-Japanese relationship into the next 50 years, said a Chinese senior diplomat on Tuesday. Yang Jiechi, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and also director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee made the remarks in a phone conversation with Akiba Takeo, secretary general of Japan's National Security Secretariat. Noting that this year marks the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan relations, Yang said bilateral ties have come to a major historical juncture. He pointed out the current situation facing China-Japan relations remains complex and challenging, featuring both old and new problems, urging the two sides to grasp the right direction of bilateral relations and have in mind long-term interests and the big picture. For his part, Akiba Takeo said that the Japanese side is willing to deepen cooperation with China, settle differences, strengthen communication on sensitive issues in bilateral ties as well as international hotspot issues, and jointly build constructive and stable Japan-China relations. Yang also made clear China's solemn position on issues relating to Taiwan, Hong Kong and the Diaoyu Island during the conversation. The two sides also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern.
