China is fully prepared for the 14th BRICS Summit, Ma Zhaoxu, vice foreign minister and coordinator for China's BRICS Affairs, said on Tuesday. Ma made the remarks as coordinators for the emerging-market bloc grouping Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa met for the third time in the runup to Thursday's 14th BRICS Summit. Since China became the BRICS chair at the beginning of 2022, BRICS countries have made progress in trade and finance, politics, security, and people-to-people exchanges under the theme of "Foster High-quality BRICS Partnership, Usher in a New Era for Global Development," Ma said. He briefed the other coordinators about arrangements for the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum on June 22, the 14th BRICS Summit on June 23, and the High-level Dialogue on Global Development on June 24.
