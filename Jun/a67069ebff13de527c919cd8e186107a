Brazilian nurse Thuany Silva started working on the front lines during the COVID-19 pandemic in Rio de Janeiro in April 2020 and became infected with the virus a month later. For a month, Thuany's COVID-19 tests remained positive, and in the following months, the 32-year-old experienced a series of symptoms that kept her off work for six months. The symptoms included systemic infections, memory lapses, pain, fatigue and anxiety, which brought a significant psychological impact. In order to help others who shared similar experiences like her, Thuany is currently working on a PhD studying the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of Brazilians.
