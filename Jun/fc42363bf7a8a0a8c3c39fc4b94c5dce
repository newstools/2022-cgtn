China's Ministry of Water Resources said Monday that the overall situation of floods is severe since the flood season beginning on June 1. Consecutive days of heavy rainfall has already influenced provincial level regions including Fujian, Jianxi, Guangdong and Guangxi, and a level III emergency response for flood control has been initiated. According to the staff of the Chinese National Flood Control and Drought Relief headquarters, the response for flood control was originally started after the flood happens, and this year the response is based on forecasts, therefore more preparations could be made beforehand. Currently, heavy rain will still be likely to influence the Pearl River basin. In the next days,  the water levels of its main rivers, including the Xijiang, Beijiang and Hanjiang rivers, are still estimated to rise. More than 1.1 million residents in east China's Jiangxi Province were affected by torrential rain and rain-induced floods from May 28 to June 10, according to east China's Jiangxi provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters. The extreme weather has caused direct economic losses of 2.65 billion yuan after destroying farmland and houses. During the period, around 83,000 people were evacuated. As of June 8, a total of 1.79 million people in central China's Hunan Province have been affected by heavy rain that has lashed the province since June 1. Over 2,700 houses have collapsed or been seriously damaged and around 286,000 people have been evacuated in the province, according to the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters.
