Chinese State Councilor and Minister of National Defense General Wei Fenghe will visit Singapore from June 8 to 12, the ministry announced in a press release on Tuesday. Wei will also attend the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue, to be held from June 10 to 12, and deliver a speech on "China's Vision for Regional Order" to introduce China's policy, concept and practical actions in practicing multilateralism, safeguarding regional peace and stability, and promoting the building of a community with a shared future for mankind, according to the press release. In addition, he will meet with heads of delegations of relevant countries to exchange views on the international and regional situations as well as bilateral security cooperation. During his visit, Wei will also hold meetings and have talks with leaders of the Singaporean government and defense departments. The annual Shangri-La Dialogue is one of Asia's biggest security summits. The event did not take place in 2020 and 2021 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The first in-person meeting between Wei and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin may become possible as the United States has announced that Austin will attend the event.The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that China and the U.S. are working to finalize what would be the first face-to-face meeting between their top defense officials on the sidelines of the Shangri-La Dialogue, saying that such a meeting would take on extra significance because of increased tensions between China and the U.S. over southeast China's Taiwan. Global Times reported on Tuesday citing a military expert who requested anonymity that while it remains unknown if Wei and Austin will meet in Singapore, such a meeting in person is needed, because both sides have too many problems that should be discussed.
