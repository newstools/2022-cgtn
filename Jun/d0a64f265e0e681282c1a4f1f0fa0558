Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh said in a tweet on Wednesday his country's response to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) resolution is "firm and proportionate" and "the initiators are responsible for the consequences." The UN nuclear watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution criticizing Iran for failing to explain uranium traces found at three undeclared sites, diplomats at a closed-door meeting said on Wednesday. "Iran condemns the adoption of the resolution presented by the United States, Britain, France and Germany at the Board of Governors meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency as a political, unconstructive and incorrect action," a foreign ministry statement said. Iran said it disconnected some IAEA cameras monitoring its nuclear sites Wednesday, hours before the UN nuclear watchdog adopted the resolution. (With input from agencies)
