The U.S. Treasury Department has banned American money managers from buying any Russian bonds or stocks in the secondary capital markets. It's part of the latest U.S. sanctions on Moscow over its military operation in Ukraine. Despite sanctions in recent months, Americans had still been allowed to trade Russian assets already in circulation on secondary markets. The Treasury said the new ban extends to all Russian debt and that all Russian firms' shares are affected.
