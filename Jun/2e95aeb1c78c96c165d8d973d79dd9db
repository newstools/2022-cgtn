British Foreign Minister Liz Truss told the European Commission Vice President Maros Sefcovic on Monday the bloc must be willing to change post-Brexit rules governing trade with Northern Ireland, repeating that London wanted a "negotiated solution." "Our preference is a negotiated solution, but EU must be willing to change the Protocol itself," she tweeted. In another phone call on Monday, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney told Truss that her plans to override parts of the Northern Ireland protocol would create a "whole new set of uncertainties and mark a low point in its approach to Brexit," Coveney's spokesperson said in a statement.
