Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Friday hailed his country's special and high-level relations with China in a meeting with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe. Lee called on Singapore and China to continue to strengthen practical cooperation on anti-pandemic efforts and economy and trade, and maintain the sound momentum of continuous development of bilateral ties. Stressing that the international situation and the Asia-Pacific region are undergoing new changes at present, the prime minister said Singapore hopes that all countries in this region can advance communication and enhance mutual trust. Wei said China and Singapore should continue to deepen strategic mutual trust, expand the integration of interests, and support each other on issues related to their core interests and grave concerns so as to inject positive energy to maintain regional peace and stability. Wei also said that in recent years, the relationship between the two militaries has seen stable development, and both sides should continue to enhance high-level exchanges and pragmatic cooperation, in a bid to push forward their military-to-military relations. Wei arrived in Singapore on Wednesday for an official visit. He will also speak at the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue, a key Asia security forum.
