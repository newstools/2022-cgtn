Launched in 2019, the $230-million project fully funded by the Chinese government is located in the Gurandani area. Covering an area of 18 square kilometers, the new airport will be the second largest airport in Pakistan. This construction project, managed by the China Airport Construction Group, comprises 32 components, including runways, taxiways, aprons, a terminal, and airport support infrastructure, utilities and facilities. By now, 40 percent of the project has been completed, and the terminal is taking shape.
