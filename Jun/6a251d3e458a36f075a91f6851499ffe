Air passenger volume is expected to hit 83 percent of pre-pandemic levels this year and the aviation industry's return to profit is "within reach" in 2023, the International Air Transport Association (IATA) said on Monday. "Airlines are resilient. People are flying in ever greater numbers. And cargo is performing well against a backdrop of growing economic uncertainty," IATA Director-General Willie Walsh said in an upgraded industry forecast for 2022.
