China has adopted advanced technology to help farmers in their summer harvest, planting and field management, ensuring a high yield and bumper harvest. Skilled agricultural technicians in east China's Anhui Province use mobile phones to control the route of unmanned harvesters. "Compared with traditional tractors, unmanned driving enhances the accuracy and efficiency of the operation and reduces costs. [It can] achieve synchronous operation 24 hours a day," said Li Wei, technical engineer of Weichai Lovol Smart Agriculture Research Institute. At a wheat field in Weifang, a city in east China's Shandong Province, two unmanned wheat harvesters equipped with yield measurement software are working efficiently. The agricultural command center uses a smart agricultural management platform, satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), sensors and other technologies to monitor the growth of crops, soil moisture and meteorological data to advise farmers in their summer farming with accurate data. "Wheat was sown late last year. However, under the guidance of the big data of the smart agricultural management platform, the field management of wheat has been done well. The overall wheat harvest this year is about 9,000 kilograms per hectare," said Zhu Long, a farmer in Weifang. This year, more than 650,000 combine harvesters were put into wheat harvesting, including more than 130,000 with China's Beidou satellite navigation system, up 40 percent from last year.
