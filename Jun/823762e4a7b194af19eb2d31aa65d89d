Chinese teenager Zheng Qinwen held off 21-year-old compatriot Wang Xiyu to grab her first WTA 125 title at the Valencia Open in Spain on Sunday. With the title, 19-year-old Zheng maintained her breakthrough form from her previous event, where she made waves at Roland Garros to reach her current career-high ranking of World No.54. At Roland Garros, in only her second Grand Slam main-draw appearance, the Hubei native upset 2018 champion and former world No.1 Simona Halep in the second round. Zheng then gave World No.1 Iga Swiatek a scare in the Round of 16, becoming the only player to take a set off of the eventual champion. The 21-year-old left-hander Wang, a former junior No.1 and 2018 Junior U.S. Open champion, was also seeking her first WTA 125 title. However, Zheng converted six of her eight break points in the final, and she is now projected to crack the Top 50 of the WTA Tour singles rankings for the first time on Monday. Meanwhile, China's two-time doubles Grand Slam champion Zhang Shuai won the doubles title in the Rothesay Open final alongside Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil, as the top seeds defeated No.4 seeds Caroline Dolehide and Monica Niculescu 7-6(2), 6-3 in the final. Zhang and Haddad Maia teamed up for the first time this week. With her season's first doubles title and 12th overall placement, the 33-year-old Tianjin native will rise to world No.3 in the doubles ranking for the first time in her career.
