The United States on Thursday announced that it will provide $6 million in emergency assistance to Sri Lanka to address the needs of the marginalized and vulnerable communities impacted by the country’s economic crisis. This new funding will also provide technical assistance to the Sri Lankan government as it implements economic and financial reform measures to stabilize the economy, in line with an anticipated International Monetary Fund (IMF) package, the U.S. embassy in Colombo said in a statement.
