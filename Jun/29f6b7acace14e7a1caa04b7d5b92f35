China won two gold medals on the fourth day of the FINA World Championships in Budapest on Monday. Yang Junxuan, 20, claimed the country's first swimming gold in the women's 200m freestyle with a time of 1:54.92. Her compatriot Tang Muhan won the bronze medal in 1:56.25, behind highly rated 18-year-old Australian Mollie O'Callaghan. The second gold was China's first in the women's artistic team technical. Yang admitted during an after-match interview that she did not expect the result. "Some world-class swimmers did not compete here, so I got the opportunity to win… It was not easy, and it was a valuable experience," said the swimmer from east China's Shandong Province.    "I did not think of the result before the championships, and I did not set up any goals. The only thing on my mind was to improve my techniques when I turned around in the pool because the gap between me and the top athletes is in detail. I caught up in the second half; I did pretty good in speed and endurance." In the women's artistic team technical, China led the preliminary stage with 94.0039 points on Sunday and improved their score to 94.7202 points in the final of 12 teams. Japan finished second with 92.2261 points, followed by Italy with 91.0191 points. Hungary's Milak smashes world record, U.S. win big Other highlights of the day include Hungarian Kristof Milak smashing his own world record to win the men's 200m butterfly, powering to the gold medal in a time of 1:50.34. The Olympic champion beat the record he set at the 2019 worlds in Gwangju by 0.39 seconds and finished 3.03 seconds ahead of silver medalist Leon Marchand of France. The 22-year-old Milak delighted the home crowd by providing them with Hungary's first gold at these championships. It was also a big day for Team USA, with three gold medals pocketed in men's 800m freestyle, men's 50m breaststroke, and the 4X100 mixed medley relay.  Team USA has maintained its dominance in swimming, with a total of 10 golds among the 19 awarded so far.
