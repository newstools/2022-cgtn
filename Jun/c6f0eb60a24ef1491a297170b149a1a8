The country's major international freight hub ports and regional hub ports have been operating stably. The freight capacity of Shanghai Pudong International Airport is recovering, handling a daily average of 215 cargo flights with 8,770 tonnes of cargo delivered. Both the number of cargo flights and the weight of delivered cargo have come back to 90 percent of the pre-COVID level. For passenger flights, the CAAC is negotiating with some other countries to gradually and steadily open more regular international flights, under the premise of effective COVID-19 prevention.
