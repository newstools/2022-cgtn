EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Josep Borrell said in a tweet on Monday that he had received official notification from Danish Foreign Minister Jeppe Kofod that Denmark plans to join the EU's defense and security policy. A majority of Danes, almost 67 percent, voted on June 1 in favor of joining the EU's common defense policy 30 years after opting out.
