Tourists nationwide are flocking to China's largest waterfall, which is now in the best shape of the year, hitting its biggest flow in this flood season. Water flow reached 485 cubic meters per second at the Huangguoshu Waterfall, located in Anshun City, southwest China's Guizhou Province, thanks to the continuous rainfall and abundant water running down from the upper stream. "The Huangguoshu Waterfall, exceedingly majestic and magnificent, impressed me a lot. I will definitely come again if I have the opportunity in the future," said a tourist.
