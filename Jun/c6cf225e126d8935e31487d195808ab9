The first flight to send asylum seekers from the UK to Rwanda was canceled on June 14 after a ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), citing "the risk of inhuman and degrading treatment." Despite criticism and legal challenges from ECHR judges, the British government said it is going ahead with plans for a flight. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees said the plan is a violation of international law.
