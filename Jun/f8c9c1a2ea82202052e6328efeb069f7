Iran said on Tuesday that it has never avoided the negotiating table and believes that diplomacy is the best way to reach an agreement, Mehr News Agency has reported. "We believe negotiations and diplomacy are the best ways to reach the final point of the agreement," Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said during a joint press conference with his Pakistani counterpart Bilawal Bhutto Zardari in Tehran on Tuesday. Tehran last week condemned an "unconcstructive" move by the International Atomic Energy Agency to censure the country for alleged failure to cooperate regarding its nuclear program. It also disconnected some of its cameras at nuclear sites, a move the IAEA warned could deal a "fatal blow" to negotiations to revive the nuclear deal.
