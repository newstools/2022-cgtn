Outgoing Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Carrie Lam said on Thursday Hong Kong is now on a new start of the right track in her final question and answer session in the Legislative Council. Lam's five-year tenure is set to end on July 1, when the newly appointed John Lee will take over. "Although the society has different evaluation of my work, I can say boldly that I have delivered a report card I am not ashamed of," Lam told the session. She mentioned the widespread unrest in 2019 sparked by a now-defunct fugitive bill, the most severe challenge the city has experienced since its return to the motherland in 1997. The turbulence has shown that a good relationship between the executive team and the legislation group must be based on the "One Country, Two Systems" principle, she said, also calling to make sure "patriots governing Hong Kong." Given these guarantees and confidence, Hong Kong is more confident that it can make good use of its unique advantages and better integrate into the overall development of the country, she said.
