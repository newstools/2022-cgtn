The Israeli parliament unanimously approved early on Tuesday a draft bill to dissolve parliament, a key legislative step that pushes the country closer towards its fifth election in less than four years. According to the bill, parliament would dissolve, with new elections to be held on October 25 or November 1, with the date to be set after further negotiations.
