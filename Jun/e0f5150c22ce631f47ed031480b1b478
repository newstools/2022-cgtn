The 1992 Consensus, which defines the nature of cross-Strait relations, as both the mainland and Taiwan belong to one China, is the greatest common denominator for improving and developing cross-Strait relations and should not be distorted, let alone discarded, a mainland spokesperson said Wednesday. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, made the remarks in response to a recent statement by the Chinese Kuomintang regarding the 1992 Consensus at a press conference. Ma underscored the role of adhering to the 1992 Consensus and opposing "Taiwan independence" in promoting the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and safeguarding peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits. He called on all political parties, groups and individuals on the island with the same goal to take a firm stand against secession aimed at "Taiwan independence" and external interference. Ma urged them to work with the mainland to promote the peaceful development of cross-Strait relations and safeguard peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits, thus benefiting compatriots on both sides of the Strait and safeguarding national interests.
