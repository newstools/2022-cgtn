Scientists in Australia have discovered what is believed to be the largest plant on Earth. The ancient plant, discovered at Shark Bay, a world heritage site located off Western Australia coast, stretches across 180 kilometers. The plant growing underwater is estimated to be at least 4,500 years old. Researchers from the University of Western Australia and Flinders University made the discovery and say the plant is a single clone of Posidonia australis seagrass. The study was published in Proceedings of the Royal Society B on Wednesday.
