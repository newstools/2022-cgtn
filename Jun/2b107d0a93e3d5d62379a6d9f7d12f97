The southern Chinese province of Guangdong has provided many job opportunities for Hong Kong and Macao graduates in recent years. A small number of candidates have secured government roles in an unprecedented recruitment plan. Alvin Wong is among the first Hong Kong natives to have secured a mainland government position. His job is designed to help attract foreign investment and provide guidance to startups in Nansha, a free trade zone in the south of Guangzhou. Alvin was only three years old in 1997 when Hong Kong was returned to China. Twenty-five years on, he hopes to become a facilitator as China strengthens its global economic status.
