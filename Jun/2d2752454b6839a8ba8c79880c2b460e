The COVID-19 pandemic has had a severe impact on farmers whose agricultural products such as honey, lavender, and cheese were stranded in Xinjiang’s Ili Kazak autonomous prefecture. He Jiaolong, the deputy director of the Bureau of Culture and Tourism of Ili, went to work during the day and led free marketing campaigns in her free time, promoting products for farmers. So far, she has live streamed more than 300 times, and the total product sales have been over $30 million, creating jobs for 3,000 people and helping more than 10,000 local farmers increase their incomes.
