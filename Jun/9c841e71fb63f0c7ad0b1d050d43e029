The U.S. Supreme Court has declared for the first time that the country's Constitution protects an individual's right to carry a handgun in public for self-defense. It's a landmark victory for gun rights advocates. The ruling was 6-3, with the conservative justices in the majority and liberal justices in dissent. It struck down New York state's limits on carrying concealed handguns outside one's home. The court found that it violated a person's right to "keep and bear arms" under the Constitution's Second Amendment. The White House expressed "disappointment" over the ruling, and some law experts expressed worries.
