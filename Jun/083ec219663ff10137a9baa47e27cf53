Three astronauts were selected for the Shenzhou-14 manned mission, which will be launched at 10:44 a.m. Beijing time on June 5. The crew is part of the second batch of astronauts China has trained. One made history as China's first woman in space. Shenzhou-14 marks the first manned space mission in the construction phase of China's space station. The three-member crew is expected to stay in orbit for six months. Like the previous missions, the Shenzhou-14 crew will give classes from space to youth on Earth.
