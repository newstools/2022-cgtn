At least one person was killed and dozens injured as a car crashed into a crowd in the western Berlin district of Charlottenburg on Wednesday, according to the emergency services. A vehicle struck a crowd of people on Tauenzienstrasse in Berlin's Charlottenburg neighborhood, German media outlet DW reported. Berlin police spokesperson Martin Dams said the incident happened near the popular Kurfuerstendamm shopping boulevard in the west of the German capital. He said the suspected driver of the vehicle was detained. It was unclear whether the incident was the result of an accident or whether the driver had intentionally driven into the crowd, Dams said. A China Media Group reporter has learned that the police have cordoned off the area, and several ambulances were deployed to the scene. The incident took place near the scene of a fatal attack on December 2016, when a Tunisian asylum seeker hijacked a truck and killed the driver, and then plowed it into a crowded western Berlin Christmas market, killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others.
