The seven-day average for COVID-19 cases in the U.S. is more than six times higher than a year ago, according to a report on The Hill, a political website. The Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center reported a seven-day average of 119,725 COVID-19 cases as of Saturday. That figure held at 17,887 cases on May 28 of last year, according to the report. In recent weeks, confirmed daily cases in the United States have been rising again, powered by a rising tide of Omicron subvariants currently circulating the country. The United States is averaging about 110,000 new cases each day, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Experts believe the real count of cases is much higher as many were underreported due to at-home COVID-19 tests. While new deaths are relatively low, the total known U.S. deaths from COVID-19 recently surpassed 1 million. Health officials said the United States is in the midst of yet another COVID-19 wave. They have warned Americans to exercise caution ahead of a possible surge.
