Clashes between local youths and police have left two dead in Senegal's capital Dakar on Friday, as officers blocked access to the home of opposition leader Ousmane Sonko. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to disperse stone-throwing protesters. Sonko had called for the protests after he was barred from contesting the legislative election in July. The Constitutional Council recently invalidated the opposition's national slate of candidates that included Sonko. The opposition coalition denounced a presidential ploy to disqualify its candidates.
