Native to central and southwestern China, Davidia involucrata, also known as the dove-tree, is a small flowering tree with showy creamy bracts. The bracts turn white as the flowers mature. Dove-trees generally flower between mid-April and mid-May, but the flowers lack a corolla, so the bracts play an important role in protecting pollen. The plant is a "living fossil" and under first-class state protection in China. Take a look at this video of dove-trees in Huanglong Scenic and Historic Interest Area in southwest China's Sichuan Province.
