British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's Conservative Party was defeated in two parliamentary by-elections on Friday, in a sign of the depth of voter discontent after months of scandals and a growing cost of living crisis. The defeats, including one in a previously safe seat, could renew speculation about Johnson's future after he earlier this month survived a move by Conservative lawmakers against him. The centrist Liberal Democrat party won the seat of Tiverton and Honiton, in a deeply Conservative part of southwest England, with a majority of over 6,000, overturning a majority of more than 24,000 that was won by the Conservatives in 2019.
