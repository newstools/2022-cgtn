Sri Lanka announced a two-week halt on all fuel sales except for essential services. The cash-strapped country started the sales ban on June 27, while the official said the sales suspension is meant to save petrol and diesel for emergencies as fuel reserves hit rock bottom with barely enough supplies for just one more day. Sri Lanka is facing its worst economic meltdown, and has been unable to finance even the imports of essentials.
