Dani Alves has confirmed he is leaving Barcelona a mere seven months after he rejoined the club. The Spanish giants told the Brazilian his contract won't be extended and he will now leave on June 30th.The 39-year-old joined the Catalans during last season's winter transfer window as a free agent from Sao Paulo and was a key part of the initial resurgence of Barca under Xavi Hernandez. The right back played in 14 La Liga matches, scoring once with three assists upon his return after six years away. His current deal expires at the end of the month, but he had requested a new one that would run until at least the end of the year, as he hoped that continuing at the Camp Nou would keep him in contention to make the Brazil squad for the World Cup in Qatar in November. However, Alves has now been informed that he will not be offered a new deal this summer.
