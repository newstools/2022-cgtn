Suspected jihadists killed around 10 police overnight in an attack in northern Burkina Faso near the border with Niger, security sources said on Friday. "An outlying gendarmerie post in Seytenga in Seno province was targeted by terrorists last night," a source said, also publishing a provisional death toll. Another security source confirmed the attack as the latest in a string of bloody assaults in the landlocked Sahel state.
