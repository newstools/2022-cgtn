Hong Kong's Victoria Harbor has long been a trademark of the city's beauty and affluence. There are plenty of ferries and boat rides that cruise the iconic stretch of water, but one Chinese shipping giant promises to take that experience to the next level. Chu Kong Shipping Enterprises (CKS) is one of the largest and oldest state-owned companies operating in the city, with a big economic and social impact across the region. When Hong Kong was hit by the fifth wave of COVID-19 infections earlier this year, CKS was among the first to open emergency shipping routes to Hong Kong, transporting essential food and hospital supplies. CGTN recently sat down with the boss to discuss what the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the motherland means for the long-standing state-owned firm, and what makes the "Oriental Pearl" shine.
