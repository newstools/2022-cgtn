The Ukrainian authorities disposed of nearly 150 rounds of unexploded ordnance on Wednesday in the Kyiv region. Bomb disposal technicians detonated various types of Russian ordnance that failed to explode in the capital's vicinity. Regional Governor Oleksiy Kuleba told the media that demining efforts could take years due to the volumes involved.
