In the U.S., the recent mass shootings in Texas and New York have reignited calls for greater gun control measures. Some people want to expand what is called "red flag" gun laws, which seek to prevent at-risk people from getting firearms. But many Americans are against implementing such measures. Reports say the new gun control bill is highly unlikely to pass in the U.S. Senate. Bipartisan negotiations will continue this week as U.S. President Joe Biden calls for tougher control measures. Einar Tangen, a political and economic affairs commentator, shares his views on this issue.
