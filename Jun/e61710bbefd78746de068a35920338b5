China's securities regulator on Tuesday denied media reports that it asked foreign investment banks for salary details of senior executives and executive pay curbs. Bloomberg earlier reported that China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) warned the banks in meetings in Shanghai and Beijing. "The report is not factual," said CSRC in a statement. While not specifying what report it referred to, CSRC said it and its relevant securities regulatory bureaus and industry associations "have never held those meetings."
