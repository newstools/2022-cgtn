Young Chinese tennis players Zheng Qinwen and Wang Xiyu will face off to contend for the championship after beating their respective rivals at the Valencia Open in Spain on Saturday. This will be the first Women's Tennis Association final for both players. Third-seeded Zheng defeated top seed, world No. 51 Spaniard Nuria Parrizas-Diaz 6-3, 4-6, 7-5 in two hours and 41 minutes. The 19-year-old Chinese, who stunned the world by outclassing former champion Simona Halep, has been in perfect form after advancing into the last 16 at the French Open. World No. 1 and French Open champion Iga Swiatek kept her winning streak en route to winning the title. The unbeatable Pole only suffered one set down from Zheng during their clash. Zheng's world ranking has skyrocketed during the past year. Currently ranked No. 54, she is set to become China's new top-ranked player next week, surpassing veteran Zhang Shuai. In another semifinal during the clay-court event, 21-year-old Chinese Wang Xiyu swept Swedish Mirjam Bjorklund 6-3, 6-4, pushing her world ranking into the top 100 for the first time. The final will take place on Sunday. Zhang Shuai partnered left-handed Beatriz Haddad Maia of Brazil on the grass court at Nottingham Open to reach the final after beating Shuko Aoyama/ Chan Hao-ching 6-4 6-4.
