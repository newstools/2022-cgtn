The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has decided to delegate to individual federations and disciplines any decision about whether to allow transgender athletes to compete. Replying to criticism from tennis great Martina Navratilova who accused the Olympic Committee of a "lack of leadership" for not tackling the issue, IOC spokesperson Mark Adams insisted that the organization "can't come forward with one rule, one short rule that fits everybody" and that it must be up to federations and disciplines to make a decision. The IOC also announced that the International Boxing Association would be excluded from the Olympics. It also announced that women's Nordic combined won't be added to the 2026 Winter Games, a decision on Friday that confirms skiing as the only Olympic sport lacking gender equality. The long-term Olympic future of Nordic combined was also put in doubt with no commitment to keep the men's event on the program in 2030. (With input from AP)
