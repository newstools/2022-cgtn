Baihetan, China's first 2,000-tonne offshore wind farm installation vessel, was launched on Wednesday in Guangzhou, south China's Guangdong Province. Built by China Three Gorges Corporation, the 126-meter-long, 50-meter-wide vessel has a full load displacement of 37,000 tonnes and integrates functions such as transport, self-elevation, self-propulsion, lifting and dynamic positioning. With a maximum variable load of 6,500 tonnes and a deck area of 4,200 square meters, the vessel can be used for the installation of offshore wind turbines of up to 15 megawatts. The vessel is able to lift goods as heavy as 2,000 tonnes and work underwater as deep as 70 meters, which greatly enhances the country's construction and installation capacity in offshore deep-water and off-lying sea areas. The construction of the vessel started in July 2021. It is expected to be delivered and put into operation within this year, and will be mainly operated in Guangdong and Fujian provinces, according to the company.
