Southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region has started construction on a planetarium at the world's highest altitude on Sunday, aiming to open a window for Chinese people's never-ending exploration of the universe at the "roof of the world." Scheduled to be completed in 2024, the planetarium is expected to receive over 100,000 visitors annually. The planetarium will have the region's largest optical astronomical telescope, with a one-meter-diameter lens and become a major regional base for astronomical research and public science education, according to the Science and Technology Department of Tibet.
