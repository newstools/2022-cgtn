Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer's name appeared on a hit list kept by a man who allegedly fatally shot a retired Wisconsin judge on Friday, the governor's office said on Saturday. "While the news reports are deeply troubling, we will not comment further on an ongoing criminal investigation," a spokesman for Whitmer told Reuters. The Wisconsin Department of Justice said judge John Roemer, 68, was found dead on Friday in his home after sheriffs received a call about "an armed person and two shots fired." The department called it a "targeted" attack. It said that Douglas Uhde, 56, who remains in critical condition, was found in the basement of Roemer's home with an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.
