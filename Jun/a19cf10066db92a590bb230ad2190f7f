At least four people were injured after a fire erupted in the business center Grand Setun Plaza on Friday, Moscow's emergency authorities said in a Telegram post. The authorities added that 120 people were evacuated from the building. The blaze, which covered an area of 1,000 square meters, was extinguished. It's not immediately clear what caused the incident but Russian news agency TASS earlier reported it might have been due to a short circuit. "The cause of the fire was a short circuit due to improper installation of facade lighting systems," TASS reported, citing firefighting headquarters.
