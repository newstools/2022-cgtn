Chinese doubles star Zhao Yunlei was inducted into the BWF Hall of Fame on Friday, joining doubles contemporary Liliyana Natsir in the Class of 2022. Zhao Yunlei was possibly the most versatile female doubles player of her time. She had few equals when it came to dominance in two categories over an extended period and retired as one of the most accomplished players ever – two Olympic and five World Championships gold among the several titles she picked up in her career. She retired from international badminton competition after the 2016 Olympics. BWF President Poul-Erik Hoyer Larsen hailed Zhao's inclusion into the BWF Hall of Fame. "Making the BWF Hall of Fame is the ultimate tribute in badminton," Hoyer said. "The Hall of Fame recognizes the best of the best, and Zhao surely deserves a place in this elite list." At the virtual ceremony and media event that Zhao was recognized at on Friday, Zhao said she is spending a lot of time and effort on badminton promotion in the country after retirement. "The badminton sport has not only taught me how to win the competitions, but more importantly taught me how to face calmly different [kinds] of problems in my life. And this is why I want to pass the sports and Olympic spirits onto the young generations," Zhao said. (With input from AP)
