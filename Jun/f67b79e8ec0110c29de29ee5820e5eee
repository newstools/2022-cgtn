Italian Matteo Berrettini showed signs of recapturing the form which took him to the Wimbledon final last year as he beat three-time Grand Slam champion Andy Murray 6-4, 5-7, 6-3 to win the Stuttgart Open on Sunday in his first tournament for three months. The world No.10 hadn't played since Indian Wells in March because of a hand injury, but has played like he has never been away in Stuttgart, improving to 28-6 on grass. The 26-year-old has now won six tour-level trophies. With his victory, Berrettini has improved to 2-1 in his ATP Head2Head series against the former World No. 1 Scot. "Coming back from an injury like that, from the first surgery on my life and then winning the tournament and not even playing my best tennis in the first round," Berrettini said in his on-court interview, "So it feels even more special. You know, three years ago I think I played one of the best week of my life and this one I think I started so-so. And then I started to play better and better and I don't know how I feels. It feels great, though." Meanwhile, Dutch wild card Tim Van Rijthoven completed a dream week at the Libema Open in ‘s-Hertogenbosch on Sunday, when the World No. 205 raced to a 6-4, 6-1 victory over Russian Daniil Medvedev to clinch a maiden ATP Tour title. "What a dream this week. I'd like to thank the tournament organization and Octagon for the wild card this week," said Van Rijthoven, who had not won a tour-level match prior to this week, in his on-court interview. "I mean, without them, this week wasn't even possible. I wouldn't even have been playing here. I would probably have been playing somewhere in England on the Challenger Tour. So, a very special thanks to you." (With input from AP and ATP officials)
