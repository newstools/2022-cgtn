Tom Brady concedes a lot has happened in the four months that have passed since he announced through social media that he was walking away from the NFL after 22 seasons and seven Super Bowl championships. For starters, the 44-year-old quarterback did an about-face and unretired six weeks later, citing “unfinished business” as one of the reasons for changing his mind and returning to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Brady subsequently also accepted a lucrative offer in broadcasting to join Fox as a football analyst after his playing career ends. For now, though, he says he's just focused on helping the Bucs win another championship. "It feels like a long time ago. A lot has happened between now and then," Brady said Thursday, shrugging off a question about why he hung up his cleats in early February only to reverse the decision in mid-March. "I feel like I've kind of moved past that point to be honest. But I'm happy I'm back with my teammates. It's going to be a great year," he added at the conclusion of the team's three-day mandatory minicamp. "We have high expectations for what we're trying to accomplish." Brady also talked about his relationship with former coach Bruce Arians, who retired a little more than two weeks after the NFL's career passing leader announced his return, and the future of long-time teammate Rob Gronkowski. He spoke less candidly about whether he had discussions with the Miami Dolphins this spring about the prospect of moving to South Florida in some capacity – possibly as a part owner, player or even both.
