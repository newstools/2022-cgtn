A military aircraft crashed in southern California on Wednesday, a spokesperson for the Marines said. There was no immediate word on casualties, but the military denied reports that the aircraft had been carrying radioactive material when it came down near Glamis, just 35 kilometers from the Mexican border. "We can confirm that an aircraft belonging to 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing crashed near Glamis," a spokesperson told AFP.
