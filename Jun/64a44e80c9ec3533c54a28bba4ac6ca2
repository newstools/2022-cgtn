China's women scored a 3-1 victory over the home side Turkey in Pool 2 at the FIVB Volleyball Nations League (VNL) on Friday. The Turkish team found it difficult to respond to China's serve shots and break through their defense, as the visitors triumphed 25-16, 20-25, 25-16, 25-22 at the Ankara Sports Hall. With China's super spiker Zhu Ting recovering from her wrist injury, 22-year-old Li Yingying took over the hitting responsibility and earned a game-high 23 points. The two teams last played with each other at the Tokyo Olympic Games in 2021, when China suffered a 0-3 loss. China started the 2022 VNL campaign on Wednesday with a comfortable 3-1 win over the Netherlands and will meet European champions Italy on Saturday and Asian rivals Thailand on Sunday. The women's VNL finals will be held in Ankara from July 13 to 17. (With input from Xinhua)
