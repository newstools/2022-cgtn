Gustavo Petro was elected president of Colombia on Sunday after defeating independent candidate Rodolfo Hernandez in the second round of elections in a very close race, the state-run National Civil Registry reported. Petro, 62, lauded the victory in a social media post. "Today is a celebration for the people. Let's celebrate the first popular victory," he wrote on Twitter. Hernandez conceded defeat shortly afterwards. "Colombians, today the majority of citizens have chosen the other candidate. As I said during the campaign, I accept the results of this election," Hernandez said in a video on social media.
