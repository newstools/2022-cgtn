English second-tier side Burnley have appointed former Manchester City captain Vincent Kompany as their new manager. The 36-year-old was in charge at Anderlecht for two years before leaving by mutual consent in May, having led them to a third place finish in last season's Belgian top-flight. Burnley brought an end to Sean Dyche's 10-year managerial tenure at the club in April and replaced him with interim boss Mike Jackson, who was ultimately unable to keep 'The Clarets' in the English Premier League. Former Belgium international Kompany spent 11 years at City, where he won four Premier League titles, two English FA Cups, four English League Cups and two FA Community Shields. The former Manchester City captain will begin his English coaching career with the northern club in the Championship, after they finished 18th in the Premier League last season. He admits there will be tough times in the beginning but is excited about the prospects for the club and is looking forward to his time there. (With input from AP)
