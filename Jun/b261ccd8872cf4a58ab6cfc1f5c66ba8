A total of 22 states across the United States will ban or restrict abortions, while 16 other states and Washington, D.C., have laws protecting the right to abortions, according to an analysis from the Guttmacher Institute. The Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last Friday and pushed back abortion laws to individual states, some of which have banned or tightened restrictions on abortions because they had trigger laws in place.
