In the Melanesian Islands, Vanuatu is located in the southwest corner of the South Pacific. Although China and Vanuatu are far apart, the two countries have achieved fruitful exchanges and cooperation in various fields. Our CGTN correspondent in Vanuatu interviewed several residents to learn about their impressions of China and their views on bilateral cooperation. Some said that China is a country with a large population and huge vision. China has been supporting the development of Vanuatu, such as building roads and bridges. They looked forward to more cooperation and development between the two countries in the future.
