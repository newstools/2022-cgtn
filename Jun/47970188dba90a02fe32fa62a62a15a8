UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his sadness by the tragic loss of life in the earthquake that struck Afghanistan earlier in the day. "My heart goes out to the people of Afghanistan who are already reeling from the impact of years of conflict, economic hardship and hunger. I convey my deep condolences to the families of the victims and wish a speedy recovery to the injured," he said on Wednesday. The earthquake struck eastern Afghanistan early Wednesday and has killed over 1,000 people, with more than 1,500 others injured. Guterres said the United Nations in Afghanistan is fully mobilized, and several UN teams are already on the ground assessing the needs and providing initial support. (With input from Xinhua)
