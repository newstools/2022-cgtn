Liverpool have accepted Bayern Munich's offer of 41 million euros (about $42.9 million) to acquire 30-year-old Senegalese striker Sadio Mane, multiple media reports said on Friday. The transfer fee is said to include a fixed 32 million euros (about $33.5 million), six million euros (about $6.3 million) based on appearances and three million euros (about $3.15 million) depending on his individual performance and team achievements. Mane made 269 appearances for Liverpool in six seasons, scoring 120 goals and 48 assists, and winning one Premier League title, one FA Cup, one UEFA Champions League, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and one EFL Cup. He played a key role with his speed in the system of manager Jurgen Klopp. However, Liverpool's acquisition of 22-year-old Uruguayan striker Darwin Nunez from Benfica for as much as 100 million euros (about $104.7 million) put Mane's future at the club in serious doubt, according to ESPN. Bayern, who have been negotiating with Barcelona over the possible transfer of Polish striker Robert Lewandowski recently, are in desperate need of a world-class scorer to fill Lewandowski's position. Mane's playing style fits the German powerhouse's tradition of launching offense on the two wings. Liverpool have been counting on the combination of Mane, Mohamed Salah and Roberto Firmino as their offensive engine for years. Nonetheless, as all of them have reached 30 years, the club began to look for replacements. Before they introduced Nunez, the team had already brought in 25-year-old Colombian forward Luis Diaz from Porto for 47 million euros (about $49.2 million) in January. Salah, who has also been involved with various transfer rumors in the past three years, still has one year left of his contract with Liverpool.
