Ecuadorian government and Indigenous leaders met on Saturday for their first formal talks since mass protests began in the country two weeks ago, President of the National Assembly Virgilio Saquicela said. The sometimes-violent demonstrations that broke out on June 13 are being driven by Indigenous calls for lower fuel and food prices, among other demands, and have led to at least six civilian deaths and multiple attacks on security forces.
