Zaheer Najeeb is the executive director of Great India Tour Company. Since the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, Zaheer and his colleagues have developed a number of tourism routes from India to China, not only including places of interest like the Great Wall and the Forbidden City but also interacting with Chinese local culture. Sharing his feelings about the journeys in China, Zaheer said: "I think it's been eye-opening, it's not just in terms of tourism destination, but also Chinese lifestyle." Zaheer thought he knew China better after interacting with the locals. Currently, Zaheer's tourism business between the two countries has been suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but he really hopes it will return to normal soon.
