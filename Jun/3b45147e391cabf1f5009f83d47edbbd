China's weather forecasters are warning that more floods could happen next week. This comes as heavy rainstorms continue to batter the southern region. Over 50 rivers in the Pearl River Basin have seen waters exceeding warning levels, after days of torrential rain. Chinese central authorities have sent emergency materials, including tents and beds, to the regions affected.
