"When the Americans came to our country, they claimed they were humanitarians, but most of the time, they did the opposite." For civilians who survived U.S. drone strikes, life would never be the same again. Mohammad Naseem is a 27-year-old rural teacher living in Afghanistan's Wardak Province. He and his cousin were hit by a drone while working on their farm. The attack killed his cousin, while his left leg was blown off by the bomb. There is still shrapnel lodged in his body, which pains him incessantly. However, due to a lack of money, and poor access to medical treatment, he has not been able to receive the operations he needs.
