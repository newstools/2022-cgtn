Bulgarian lawmakers gave the government the green light on Friday to approve a European Union membership negotiation framework for North Macedonia, a move that may allow its neighbor to start membership negotiations talks with the bloc. Lawmakers voted for the government to lift its veto on the framework, imposed in 2020 over a dispute about history and language.
