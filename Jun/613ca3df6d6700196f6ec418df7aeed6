The virus that causes polio has been detected in several sewage samples in the British capital, the first sign since the 1980s that the virus could be spreading in the country. Authorities have not found any related cases of the polio illness, which causes paralysis in children in under 1% of infections. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) said the risk was 'low' because of high vaccination coverage.
