It was a rainy Monday, but the drizzle did not hinder students from going back to school. With Beijing's latest COVID-19 outbreak under control, primary and high school students returned to the classroom on Monday. "I've packed another pencil to class and a pen with fast-dry effects," said Zhao Zilu, a student from Beijing Affiliated Elementary School of Chaoyang Normal School. Bi Shihan, an elementary student who attends the same school as Zhao, told CGTN that she is happy because she "can go back to school and meet teachers and classmates." The resumption is not only bringing joy to students. "I'm happy for her mother," said Bi Hua, Bi Shihan's father, explaining that it would mean less stress on his wife, who would help his daughter study every day. "The reopening is good for every family." When returning to school, students must present COVID-19 test results taken within 48 hours, as well as the results of those they live with. "Teachers also suggested us parents prepare disinfecting wipes for children, and the school will check temperatures when children enter the gate," said Li Fengyan, one of the parents who sent her son to the school. Middle and high school seniors returned to school before Monday to take graduation exams. The Beijing Municipal Education Commission said on Saturday that students living in communities under quarantine should continue to study online. Meanwhile, summer breaks for middle and elementary schools in Beijing should go ahead as scheduled on July 15. Since the new outbreak in late April and early May, kindergarten, primary, middle and high school students in Beijing were asked not to attend class to avoid contracting and spreading COVID-19, as the city was reporting dozens of new locally transmitted cases daily. The students returned to campus on Monday after over 50 days of remote education.
