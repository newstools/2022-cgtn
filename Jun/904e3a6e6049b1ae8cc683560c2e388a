The MLB's Houston Astros and their designated hitter and leftfielder Yordan Alvarez have agreed over a six-year, $115-million contract extension, according to ESPN's Jeff Passan. Alvarez's new deal will begin to take effect from the 2023 season and will buy out three of his free-agent seasons. In return, he will get $26 million guaranteed money for those seasons. No player whose major position is designated hitter has ever had a contract as big as his in MLB history. Moreover, only four players have signed bigger deals than Alvarez without reaching arbitration: Fernando Tatis Jr., 14-year, $340 million with the San Diego Padres; Wander Franco, 11-year, $182 million with the Tampa Bay Rays; Buster Posey, eight-year, $159 million with the San Francisco Giants; and Mike Trout, six-year, $144.5 million with the Los Angeles Angels. Having made his Major League debut in 2019, Alvarez won the Rookie of the Year Award unanimously with a batting average (BA) of .313, an on-base percentage of .412 and a slugging percentage (SLG) of .655 in 87 games. Though Alvarez only played two games in the 2020 season before undergoing surgeries to repair both of his knees, he continued to slug well after recovery. In the 2021 season, he got a career-high 33 home runs in addition to 104 runs batted in (RBIs). The Astros finished the regular season 95-67 to top the American League (AL) West. In the AL Championship Series (ALCS) against the Boston Red Sox, Alvarez was 12 (hits)-for-23 (at bats), including 4-for-4 in Game 6 that ended the series. He was named the ALCS Most Valuable Player for his incredible performance for the Astros. The Astros are currently 34-18 to lead the AL West. Alvarez has driven 31 runs and 14 homers, the third-most in the Major League.
