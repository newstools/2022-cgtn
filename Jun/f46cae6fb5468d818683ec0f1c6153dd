Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with Mark Brown, prime minister and foreign minister of the Cook Islands, via video link on Thursday where the Chinese official said China will continue seeking development in ties with the South Pacific country. Since China established diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands, the two sides have respected each other, treated each other as equals and promoted exchanges and cooperation in various fields, Wang pointed out. Specifically, trade volume between the two countries has increased by nearly 300 times. China will take the 25th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to continuously enhance mutual trust and deepen practical cooperation with the Cook Islands, so as to bring more benefits to the two peoples, Wang said. He called on further cooperation in areas including tourism, infrastructure and education. For his part, Brown said the Cook Islands appreciates the long-term support from China, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. The good relations and close cooperation between the two countries have strongly confirmed that China treats small countries sincerely and practices the concept of mutual benefit with practical actions, he said. Brown said he cherishes relations with China, firmly believes that the future of the Cook Islands is closely linked with China, and is willing to work with China to promote greater development of bilateral relations in the next 25 years. The Cook Islands official added that he would encourage more youths in the country to learn Chinese in enhancing people-to-people exchanges between the two countries.
