India's 1983 Cricket World Cup winning side was presented on Saturday with a grand Opus book weighing 32 kilograms to mark the day of the nations' first Cricket World Cup win. Then India Captain Kapil Dev led the team to beat the West Indies, who were the two-time defending champions, in the 1983 final at Lord's, which was at the time one of the biggest upsets in cricket history. Dev's catch at a pivotal moment changed the match's course in India's favor despite the West Indies' fire power. Winning the 1983 World Cup made Dev the youngest-ever captain to win the title at the age of 24. (With input from AP)
