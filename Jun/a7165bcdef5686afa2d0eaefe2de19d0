Ice skaters will have to be 17 years old to compete at the highest level after the International Skating Union Council voted to raise the age limit on Tuesday. The International Skating Union (ISU) announced via Twitter that "it voted in favor of gradually increasing the age limit from 15 to 17 years for the sake of protecting the physical and mental health, and emotional well-being of Skaters." The ISU said there will be no change for the season 2022/23, and an increase to 16 years for the season 2023/24 and an increase to 17 years for the season 2024/25 and subsequent seasons. The decision came months after a Winter Olympics drugs scandal involving then-15-year-old figure skater Kamila Valieva.
