The United Nations said on Friday it had gathered information that showed the shot that killed Al Jazeera TV journalist Shireen Abu Akleh on May 11 was fired by Israeli forces. "All information we have gathered is consistent with the finding that the shots that killed Abu Akleh and injured her colleague Ali Sammoudi came from Israeli security forces and not from indiscriminate firing by armed Palestinians," UN Human Rights Office spokeswoman Ravina Shamdasani told reporters in Geneva. Israel's army responded by saying it was "not possible" to determine how Abu Akleh was killed. "The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) investigation clearly concludes that Ms. Abu Akleh was not intentionally shot by an IDF soldier and that it is not possible to determine whether she was killed by a Palestinian gunman shooting indiscriminately or inadvertently by an IDF soldier," the military said. Israeli and Palestinian officials have exchanged recriminations over the incident, which has heightened tensions. (With input from agencies)
