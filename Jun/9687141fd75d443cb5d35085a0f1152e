China's diving and swimming team have announced rosters for the upcoming FINA World Swimming Championships, featuring Olympic champion swimmers Zhang Yufei and Wang Shun, as well as teenage diving sensation Quan Hongchan. Zhang Yufei, Wang Shun and the women's 4x200m freestyle relay winners will headline a 47-member swimming team to the championships, which will be held in Budapest, Hungary from June 18 to July 3. Zhang Yufei, who won gold medals in the 200m butterfly and 4x200m freestyle relay and silvers in the 100m butterfly and mixed medley relay at the Tokyo Olympic Games, is eyeing a golden grand slam in her favorite 200m butterfly. Wang Shun, 200m individual medley Olympic champion, also hopes to complete his title collection in his sixth long-course worlds attempt, on top of his victories in the Olympic Games and short-course worlds. Li Bingjie, women's 400m bronze medalist in Tokyo, together with Yang Junxuan, Tang Muhan and Zhang Ke, will compete in the women's freestyle relay one more time in Budapest. Two-time world champion Xu Jiayu will defend his third title in a row in the men's 100m backstroke. Chinese swimmers grabbed three gold, two silver and one bronze at the 2019 FINA worlds in Gwangju, South Korea. Meanwhile, China's diving dream team will be comprised of 17 athletes, including six Olympic champions, such as Quan Hongchan, Zhang Jiaqi, Chen Yuxi and Cao Yuan, and compete in all 13 events.  Tokyo Olympics 10m platform champion Quan, 15, is the youngest member of the squad. This will be her debut at the world championships and second international competition. As a powerhouse in the sport, China swept 12 of 13 gold medals at the last world championships, and seven out of eight at last year's Tokyo Olympics. A number of young swimmers and divers will also be sent to Budapest, as China aim to train rising athletes and improve skill levels, as well as cultivate coaches for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics.
