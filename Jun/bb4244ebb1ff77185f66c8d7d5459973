President of the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions, Stanley Ng Chau-pei, says all sectors will work together to improve people's livelihoods, as the region celebrates the 25th anniversary of its return to the motherland. Ng reiterated an earlier promise by incoming Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Chief Executive John Lee Ka-chiu, who said his government will open a new chapter for the city. "I think it's a very good opportunity for us to be part of this transition," Ng said. As a member of the Hong Kong Legislative Council, Ng said he will work with his colleagues in the Federation of Trade Unions to monitor the HKSAR government. "We have eight members in the council, and there are issues that we care about, like land, housing, people's livelihood, education and the entire economic development," he said. Ng said they will coordinate, support and monitor the government's performance in these areas, and will propose solutions to the many issues that Hong Kong people are concerned about. "Workers are mostly worried about wealth inequality, aging population, housing problems and employment during the pandemic," he explained. Noting the long tradition of protecting the rights of workers in the city, Ng said he and his colleagues will set goals and a timetable for poorer residents to move into new and spacious apartments. He also promised to help Hong Kong people working in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to get more job opportunities. Ng said the federation will coordinate with the HKSAR government to achieve all these goals in the best possible way. "We offer proposals for the government to make policies in all these fields. We do these as fellow workers, as a mass organization and as a labor group," Ng said.
