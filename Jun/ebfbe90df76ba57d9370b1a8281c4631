Carson Pickett made history as the first player with a limb difference playing in the U.S. Women's National Team (USWNT) on Tuesday. Pickett, born without a left hand and forearm, made her first international appearance with the USWNT during their friendly match that ended in a 2-0 victory over Colombia at the Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah. "The 28-year-old defender may be new to the USWNT, but she has plenty of experience under her belt in the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL). The North Carolina Courage left-back picked up her 100th NWSL appearance this month and was named to the league's Best XI for June," sports editor Max Molski wrote in a piece for NBC Sports. The USWNT extended its unbeaten streak to 69 games on home soil. Lightning was reported near Rio Tinto Stadium in the 75th minute, causing play to be suspended for more than 30 minutes. It was the second of two games against Colombia as both teams prepare for Women's World Cup qualifying in July. The USWNT will try for a third straight World Cup title next summer in Australia and New Zealand. (With input from AP)
