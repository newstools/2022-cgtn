The European Commission has formally backed Ukraine's bid to join the EU. The application will be discussed as early as next week at a summit in Brussels. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy welcomed the move and said he expected a "positive result," while Russian President Vladimir Putin said he had "nothing against" Ukraine joining the EU. Putin said membership would turn Ukraine into a "semi-colony" of the West.
