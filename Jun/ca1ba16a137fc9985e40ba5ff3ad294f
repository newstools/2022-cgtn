Shopaholics in China can look forward to a number of big sale events every year. There's the March 8 International Women's Day sale, the 618 shopping festival on June 18, and a pre-Christmas 12.12 sale on December 12. But the biggest sale would undoubtedly be the Double 11 Shopping Festival, which started in 2009 in China, and is still going strong. E-commerce platforms in countries like Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore have also participated in this shopping festival that is no longer just a way of shopping online, but a cultural phenomenon.
