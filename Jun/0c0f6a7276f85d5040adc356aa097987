Cassidy Hutchins, a former top aide to Donald Trump's chief of staff, Mark Meadows, testified on Tuesday that she had been told that the then-president lunged to grab the steering wheel of his limousine when his secret service agent refused to take him to Capitol Hill. Later, Trump denied having grabbed the wheel on social media, describing it as a "fake story," according to reports by France 24.
