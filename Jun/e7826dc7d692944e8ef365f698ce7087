Turkish news agency Anadolu reports that the United Nations (UN) has registered "Türkiye" as the new name to be used in place of Turkey as its internationally recognized name in English. The news agency said UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric confirmed that the organization had received Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu's letter requesting the name change. The spokesman also said it took effect the moment the letter was received. Cavusoglu said on Twitter that the name change is to enhance the prestige of the country's brand.
