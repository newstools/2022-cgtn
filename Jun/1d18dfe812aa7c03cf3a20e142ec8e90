Euro 2020 winners Italy face 2021 Copa America champions Argentina in the first Finalissima at London's Wembley Stadium on Wednesday. The contest is a modern revival of the discontinued CONMEBOL-UEFA Cup of Champions, also called the European/South American Nations Cup and the Artemio Franchi Cup, but now rebranded as the Finalissima. Despite claiming the Euro 2020 title at Wembley against hosts England, Italy failed to qualify for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar. "It is a great pleasure to be here. It is always a pleasure to return to Wembley because it is a fantastic stadium," said Italy coach Roberto Mancini. "Especially for us, that 12 months ago, we were celebrating the Euro title here. I am feeling all the emotions remembering all that." The clash in London is also poised to mark the end of Giorgio Chiellini's international career. The 37-year-old center-back will make his 117th appearance for Italy, joining Daniele De Rossi in fourth place on the country's all-time list. "I'm at peace. I feel happy with what I achieved and a little bit of pride for what I achieved in my career," said Chiellini, who has already played his last game for Juventus after 17 years with the club, but will continue his career with Major League Soccer side LAFC. Argentina coach Lionel Scaloni praised Italy ahead of the Finalissima and lamented that the European champions are "undeservedly" missing out on this year's World Cup. "We are talking about the reigning European champion not less than a year ago. They are a top national team," said Scaloni. "I think they are missing the World Cup because the ball did not want to get in the goal and that's something that only happens in football." Argentina, who will be led on the pitch by star striker Lionel Messi, wrapped up their preparations for the historic showdown with a series of warm-weather training sessions in Bilbao, Spain.
