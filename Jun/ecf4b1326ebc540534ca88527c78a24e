BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) has embarked on a righteous course of mutual support and win-win cooperation, Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday. "Standing at the crossroads of history, we should both look back at the journey we have traveled and keep in mind why we established BRICS in the first place, and look forward to a shared future of a more comprehensive, close, practical and inclusive high-quality partnership so as to jointly embark on a new journey of BRICS cooperation," Xi said at the 14th BRICS Summit in Beijing via video. He mentioned that he put forward the Global Development Initiative (GDI) last year to re-energize the implementation of the UN's 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and build a global community of development. "China stands ready to work with BRICS partners to add more substance to the GDI and contribute to stronger, greener and healthier global development," Xi said. (Cover image: CFP)
