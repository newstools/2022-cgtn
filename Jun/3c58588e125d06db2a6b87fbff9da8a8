At least 49 people, including six firefighters, have been killed and nearly 300 people are receiving treatment in hospitals after a fire tore through a container depot and caused explosions on June 5. The fire broke out in a container loaded with chemicals at a private container depot in Sitakunda on the outskirts of Chattogram in Bangladesh.  A team of soldiers joined the rescue efforts after the accident took place. The Bangladeshi government vowed to carry out a thorough investigation into the accident and announced 50,000 takas (about $556) in compensation to each of the victims' families and 20,000 takas (about $222) in aid to each of the injured.
