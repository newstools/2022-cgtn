China successfully sent nine satellites into orbit aboard a Long March-2C rocket on Thursday from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province. The satellites will serve the future travel services of intelligent connected vehicles and mobile phone-satellite interaction. This was the 422th flight mission of the Long March rocket series.
