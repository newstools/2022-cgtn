Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers participated in a charity fundraiser on Wednesday. The team partnered with the National Pediatric Cancer Foundation (NPCF) for "Cut and Color for a Cure," where players and staff had their hair shaved or just colored by pediatric cancer patients to support the fight against childhood cancer. Bucs' head coach Todd Bowles, general manager Jason Licht, quarterback Brady, wide receiver Mike Evans, defensive lineman Will Gholston, and offensive linemen Ryan Jensen, Donovan Smith and Tristan Wirfs were among the dozens of players and staff members in attendance. As for Brady, his legendary hair now has a distinct tinge of both red and creamsicle, all for a great cause. "It is devastating for these children and families to battle cancer, but the children are fighters, and when they have a championship team behind them, it means a lot to these families," NPCF CEO David Frazer said. This was the team's eighth year championing the pediatric cancer research initiative, having raised more than $500,000 for NPCF over the previous seven years. (With input from AP)
