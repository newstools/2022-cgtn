President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced U.S. reinforcements of NATO forces in Europe, saying the alliance is needed more today "than it ever has been." NATO will be "strengthened in all directions across every domain – land, air and sea," he said at a summit of the transatlantic alliance being held in Madrid, Spain. Biden confirmed that the U.S. will raise the number of destroyers in Spain to six from four and Washington will send two additional F-35 squadrons to Britain and establish the 5th Army headquarters in Poland.
