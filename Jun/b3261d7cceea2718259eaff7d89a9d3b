Suspected Islamists killed at least 18 people in a village raid in eastern Congo on Sunday night, local sources told Reuters, while fighting resumed with the M23 rebel group in a neighboring province. Fighters believed to be from the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) killed residents and burned down houses in the village of Otomabere, in Irumu territory, Ituri province, said a witness, a local chief and a local human rights group. Congolese army spokesman Jules Ngongo confirmed the ADF attack without giving a death toll, and said Congolese forces were in pursuit of the assailants.
