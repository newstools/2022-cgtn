The top economist at the UN Food and Agriculture Organization says the Cereal Price Index hit an all-time high in May. That was mainly driven by wheat prices, which were up 5.6 percent from April and 56.2 percent from their corresponding value a year earlier. Maximo Torero says the gap in wheat stands at 3 million metric tons, in part because of the conflict in Ukraine.
