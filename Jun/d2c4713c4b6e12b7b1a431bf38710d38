There is now a second COVID-19 option for kids aged six to 17 in the U.S. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Friday announced it is recommending Moderna shots as an option for school-age kids and teens. This group has been able to get shots made by Pfizer since last year. CDC sets the federal government's vaccine guidance for U.S. doctors and their patients. Last week, the Food and Drug Administration authorized the shots – full-strength doses for children ages 12 to 17 and half-strength for those six to 11. The doses are to be given about a month apart. An expert advisory panel this week voted unanimously to recommend that CDC endorse the Moderna shots, too. Moderna officials have said they expect to later offer a booster to all kids aged six to 17.
