Team China's Chen Yufei and He Bingjiao eased past the first round of the women's singles at the Indonesian Masters on Wednesday as Chen beat compatriot Wang Zhiyi and He swept past Putri Kusuma Wardani, both by 2-0. Olympic gold medalist Chen has not won a title in the four tournaments she played this season and is hoping to end her title drought. Chen took an easy win in the opening set 21-13 and came back from behind to beat 22-year-old Wang 21-18 in the second set after Wang led by 6-0. Wang has had a roller coaster ride this season, winning her first Badminton Asian Championships title before losing the deciding match in the Uber Cup final, which cost Team China its chance to defend the title. Also on Wednesday, He Bingjiao denied the aggressive performance of Wardani, for whom the home crowd cheered loudly, advancing to the next round 21-16, 21-14. (With input from Xinhua)
