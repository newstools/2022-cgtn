Israeli lawmakers unanimously voted to dissolve the parliament on Thursday after Prime Minister Naftali Bennett's coalition government lost its majority, triggering unprecedented fifth elections in less than four years. The 120-member Knesset voted 92-0 in favor of dissolution and holding the next elections on November 1, a parliamentary spokesperson said in a statement. Bennett is expected to hand over power to Foreign Minister Yair Lapid, leader of the centrist Yesh Atid party, under the power-sharing deal they agreed upon following inconclusive elections in 2021. Lapid will officially become the caretaker prime minister on Friday and will hold the position until the next government is formed.
