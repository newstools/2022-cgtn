Chinese President Xi Jinping and Guyanese President Irfaan Ali on Monday exchanged congratulatory messages on the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries. China-Guyana relations have witnessed rapid development during the past 50 years, with deepening political mutual trust and remarkable achievements made in practical cooperation, Xi said. He hailed the mutual support and assistance between the two sides in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, describing it as a new chapter of China-Guyana friendship. Xi said he attaches great importance to the development of China-Guyana relations and is ready to work with Ali to bring bilateral ties to a new height to benefit the two countries and their peoples. Ali said Guyana was the first English-speaking Caribbean nation to establish diplomatic ties with China, adding that the country firmly adheres to the one-China policy. During the past 50 years, the two countries have always followed the principles of mutual respect, equality and mutual benefits in developing their ties, and their traditional friendly relationship has withstood the test of time, said the Guyanese president. Guyana stands ready to take the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the two countries' diplomatic ties as an opportunity to further deepen its friendship with China, he said. China and Guyana established diplomatic relations on June 27, 1972. The two countries signed a memorandum of understanding for cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative in July 2018.
