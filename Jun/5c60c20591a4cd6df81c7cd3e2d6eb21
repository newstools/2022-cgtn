Dai Bing, China's deputy permanent representative to the United Nations, on Thursday refuted the lies fabricated by some Western countries about the situation in China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. Dai made the remarks at the United Nations Security Council high-level open debate on strengthening accountability and justice for serious violations of international law. The Chinese envoy pointed out the accusation of "genocide" and "forced labor" in Xinjiang is a flat-out lie of the century. Dai stressed the U.S. and UK are afraid their lies about "genocide" and "forced labor" will be debunked in front of the international community and they now even go as far as to mislead the international community with more lies on China. No matter how many lies the U.S. spreads, they cannot hide the fact that Xinjiang enjoys stability and prosperity, and its people live a happy and fulfilling life, he stressed. Anyone who has visited Xinjiang will never agree with the lies fabricated by the U.S. and UK, Dai said, adding their behavior only further reveals that they've turned human rights issues into a tool for politicization and exposes their plot to contain China with the Xinjiang-related issue. Dai also asked whether countries or individuals like the U.S. and the UK, who blatantly create rumors and lies, confuse the public and smear other countries, should also be held accountable.
