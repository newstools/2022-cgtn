The former leader of the American far-right Proud Boys group has been charged with seditious conspiracy over last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol. Enrique Tarrio and four other group members were indicted of plotting the attack in advance and raising money to buy bulletproof vests and other tactical gear. They had earlier pleaded not guilty to conspiracy charges relating to the Capitol attack. But Monday's grand jury indictment goes a step further alleging that they were "to oppose by force the authority of the government".
