Mexico City's main square, the Zocalo, was covered with the red, white and green of the national flag on Saturday as 14,299 people gathered to follow a mass boxing class directed by local heroes Ana Maria Torres, Jackie Nava, Mariana Juarez and David Picasso. The class lasted 30 minutes, with just two 20-second hydration breaks. In doing so, these thousands of boxing lovers broke the Guinness Record for the largest boxing class ever. The previous record was held by Moscow, Russia, when it held a mega boxing class with 3,250 participants in Red Square. (With input from AP)
