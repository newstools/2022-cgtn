Chinese President Xi Jinping on Wednesday said he warmly welcomes foreign investment to China, as the country continues to foster a market-based, law-based and internationalized business environment. Xi made the remarks while delivering a keynote speech in virtual format at the opening ceremony of the BRICS Business Forum. China has taken well-coordinated steps to respond to COVID-19, Xi said, adding that the country has protected people's lives and ensured overall stable performance in economic and social development. Next, the president said, China will step up macroeconomic policy adjustment and adopt more forceful measures to deliver the economic and social development goals for the whole year and minimize the impact of COVID-19. China will continue to pursue opening up against higher standards and share China's development opportunities with the rest of the world, he told the forum. (Cover via CFP)
