Lying at the boundary between Central Asia, East Asia and South Asia, the Pamir Mountain Range is one of the world’s highest. As such, it forms the largest geographical barrier along the ancient Silk Road, which has historically connected China with the Western world. China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) has revived the millennia-old trade route and made it much easier for people in the region to connect with each other and the outside world. This five-episode documentary series, "The Pamirs Today", reveals a diversity of cultures in the unique region, but also a commonality of values, dreams and hopes shared by people in its different countries. It recounts their efforts and perseverance in seeking a better life for their families, and above all, the opportunities brought about by the BRI. There are many touching stories. In Episode 1, we see a young couple from Tajikistan leave their three-year-old son in the care of his grandparents as they travel to study for a doctoral degree in China's Xinjiang University. In Episode 3, a Pakistani father runs a one-man restaurant by the Karakoram Highway, or the China-Pakistan Friendship Highway, to provide for his four children's education. And in Episode 5, the National Ballet Troupe of Tajikistan's young lead dancer and instructor continues in the profession he loves, in spite of its meagre salary and a serious lack of funding.
