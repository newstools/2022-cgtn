The China Aerospace Science and Technology Corporation (CASC) announced that it had completed key tests for an engine for its new generation carrier rocket for launching manned space missions. The long-duration and multiple ignition tests for the engine were successfully completed, indicating that it's ready to enter the next stage of prototype development, China's major rocket contractor said. The engine is the country's first upper-stage hydrogen-oxygen engine with a low-pressure torch ignition method, according to the CASC. The tests examined key technologies, including the state of the engine and its components, the reliability of the ignition system and the real-time fault diagnosis system. So far, the Long March-2F rocket is China's only rocket for manned missions.
