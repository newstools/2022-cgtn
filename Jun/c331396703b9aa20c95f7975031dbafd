China's third-seeded Zheng Qinwen got past local favorite Andrea Lazaro Garcia 6-4, 6-2 to advance to the second round at the WTA Valencia Open on Tuesday, winning in her first appearance since losing to world No.1 Iga Swiatek in the last 16 of this year’s French Open. The 19-year-old rose up to 54 in the world rankings after an impressive maiden performance at Roland Garros, beating former world No.1 Simona Halep and French veteran Alize Cornet in the second and third round. Zheng’s compatriot Wang Xiyu also progressed to the next round after beating Romania’s Ana Bogdan 6-1, 7-5 on Monday. China’s Wang Qiang, Wang Xinyu and Zhu Lin have started their grass court season at the Nottingham Open. Only last year’s runner-up Zhang progressed to the second round after victory over Spain’s Cristina Bucsa 7-6, 6-3.
