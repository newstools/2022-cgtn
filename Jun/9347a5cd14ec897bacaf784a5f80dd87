A road-rail bridge over the Yangtze River, China's longest river, was successfully connected in Yibin City, southwest China's Sichuan Province, with the installation of the last steel box girder. China's first cable-stayed bridge with a flat layout of highway and railway has been under construction since early 2019. The most challenging part of the final stage of construction was hoisting and installing the last steel box girder weighing 480 tons. The bridge is 1,742.1 meters long, with the main tower measuring 250 meters. It will ease travel and make it more environmentally friendly. The bridge is due to open in 2023.
