U.S. Texas Governor Greg Abbott on Tuesday declared a state of disaster in the city of Uvalde following the shooting on May 24 at Robb Elementary School which left 19 children and two teachers dead. "This disaster declaration frees up the many resources available through the State of Texas and local jurisdictions to continue providing much needed support to all who were impacted and work in the community unencumbered by regulations unnecessary to respond to this tragedy," Abbott said.
