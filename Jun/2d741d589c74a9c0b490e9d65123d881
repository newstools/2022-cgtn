A major temporary hospital for COVID-19 patients closed in Shanghai after treating nearly 48,000 people. Set up at the New International Expo Center in the Pudong New Area on March 31, the hospital had received COVID-19 patients aged from eight months to 101 years old during the latest resurgence of the virus in the business hub. Nearly 7,000 medical workers from across the country worked at the hospital. Officials said the hospital had designed special treatment plans for severe cases during its 77-day operation. Shanghai had renovated a total of 120 temporary hospitals over the past two months to fight the pandemic. By June 15, all the city-level temporary hospitals had been closed.
