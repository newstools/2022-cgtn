Kremlin Aide Yuri Ushakov said on Tuesday that the Russia-Ukraine negotiation process has been stalled, since Kyiv has not responded to proposals by Russia. He said Moscow does not reject a possible direct contact between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy, but this requires thorough preparations. There's no comment from the Ukrainian side for now on the current situation of the peace talks.
