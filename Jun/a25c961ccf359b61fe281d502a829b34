The Democratic People's Republic of Korea fired multiple projectiles on Sunday, the Republic of Korea's (ROK) Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said in a statement. The projectiles were presumed to be fired from multiple rocket launchers. The ROK's military detected the multiple trajectories from 8:07 a.m. to 11:03 a.m. local time, the JCS said in a statement. It noted that the South Korean military has strengthened surveillance and vigilance while maintaining a full readiness posture in close cooperation with the United States. A week earlier, the DPRK fired eight short-range ballistic missiles eastward from four different areas. The DPRK has conducted projectile launches four times since the new ROK government was inaugurated on May 10.
