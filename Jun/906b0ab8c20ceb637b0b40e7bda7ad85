After beating Thomas Pieters in a play-off to win the BMW International Open in Munich on Sunday, China's Li Haotong admitted that he almost gave up golf 10 months ago. The 26-year-old holed a huge putt at the first play-off hole to beat the Belgian and earn his third title on the European Tour – and his first in four years. But Li said he had told his caddy that he was ready to give up the game after struggling with his form. (With input from AP)
