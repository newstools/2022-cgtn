Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a joint press conference with his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov in Baku following their meeting on Friday. Lavrov said Russia does not believe it is threatened by the EU's decision to grant candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova, and Russia has no illusions that the EU will change its anti-Russian course any time soon. The EU's behavior shows that it does not want to honor its agreement with Russia to create a common space, Lavrov said, adding that the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) Minsk Group Co-Chairs countries was suspended at the initiative of the United States and France.
