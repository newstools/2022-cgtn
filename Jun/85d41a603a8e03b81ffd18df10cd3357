A bronze sheet was discovered during the latest excavation work at China's ancient ruins site Sanxingdui, the Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute said on Monday. Among the six newly discovered pits, No. 7 is dominated by small cultural relics, with a small volume but no less exquisite than the other pits. The bronze sheet unearthed in Pit No. 7 is only the size of a palm, but its thickness is almost the same as the commonly used A4 printing paper. It is small but very delicate. According to archaeologists, this piece of copper (Bronze primarily consists of copper) was extracted and unearthed in the northeast corner of No. 7 pit on March 5 this year. It is located close to the "Treasure of Pit" – Turtleback-shaped grid bronze. “This kind of bronze ware in the form of flake tends to have better toughness, and it is often formed by forging,” explained Li Haichao of the archaeological team of the sacrificial area of the Sanxingdui site. Now this rolled up bronze sheet has not been unfolded. When it does, will it contain inscriptions or other symbols? Especially worth looking forward to. However, its appearance, retaining the original colors of bronze 3,000 years ago, is amazing enough. The copper sheet in Pit No. 7 can retain its original color, which may be related to the burial environment and alloy composition according to the professionals. Next, archaeologists will carry out scientific and technological archaeology, conduct a comprehensive analysis of it, and explore the answer to the mystery.
