At least six people died and hundreds were seriously injured on Sunday when the grandstand at a bullring in Colombia collapsed during a popular event at which members of the public face off with small bulls, ABC News reported, citing the Tolima Civil Defense. Luis Fernando Velez, head of the regional civil defense agency, said 50 volunteers from the civil defense were working to transfer the most serious cases of nearly 300 injured spectators from the bullring to the town's hospital. Firefighters and police also helped. The local health system sent a "red alert" to the community.
