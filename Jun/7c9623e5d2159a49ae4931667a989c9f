After two years, Japan is reopening its borders for foreign tourists. Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced that international tour groups will be allowed to enter the country starting June 10, and the number of arrivals permitted per day has been increased from 10,000 to 20,000. The latest measures see countries and regions split into three groups based on infection rates. This move is to help the government decide on a road map for a larger reopening by the end of 2022.
