A brown colored baby deer, named Miracle, who has Albino deer parents, is seen at Baskonus Plateau which is among the important centers of highland tourism in Kahramanmaras, Turkey on June 19, 2022. All albino creatures are white due to a lack of a pigment in the body. A colored birth from an albino deer is not normally seen.
