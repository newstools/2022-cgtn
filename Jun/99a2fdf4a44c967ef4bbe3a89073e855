Locals and medical workers transported the injured on foot as landslides blocked roads due to torrential rains in Rongshui Miao Autonomous County, south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. After two hours of walk, they finally got out of the area hit by landslides and shifted the injured to an ambulance. Torrential rains have hit parts of Guangxi over the last few days, raising water levels and causing landslides. The local meteorological department said heavy rainfall is expected to hit northern parts of the region in the next few days.
