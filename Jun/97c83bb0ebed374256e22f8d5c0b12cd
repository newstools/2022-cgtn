Afghanistan has released five British nationals from detention, UK's Foreign Commonwealth and Development Office said in a statement on Monday. "These British nationals had no role in the UK Government's work in Afghanistan and traveled to Afghanistan against the UK Government's travel advice," the statement added. No further details were given about the Britons nor when they were held and on what grounds.
