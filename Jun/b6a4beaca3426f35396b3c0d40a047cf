Monsoon rains in Bangladesh have killed at least 25 people and unleashed devastating floods that left more than four million others stranded, police told AFP Saturday. Lightning strikes during the rains have killed 21 people across the South Asian nation since Friday, and four others died in landslides, district police officers said.
