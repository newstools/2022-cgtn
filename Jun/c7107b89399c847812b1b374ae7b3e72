Chinese ink and wash painting was invented during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) more than 1,000 years ago. The art form, usually applied with long-haired brushes, has evolved over the centuries with painters using various methods to contribute to a rich tradition. Wang Mingming is one of the most acclaimed contemporary ink painters of our time. The 70-year-old is now presenting his 13-year body of work spanning 2006 to 2019 to the public in Beijing.
