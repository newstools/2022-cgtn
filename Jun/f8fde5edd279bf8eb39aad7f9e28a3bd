Wuhan Three Towns smashed Guangzhou FC 6-0 on Tuesday to condemn the eight-time Chinese Super League champions to their worst ever league defeat. Nicolae Stanciu gave Three Towns the lead with a free-kick in the 11th minute, and Davidson made it 2-0 in the 29th minute when he capitalized on a scramble in front of goal. Guangzhou defender Jiang Guangtai was definitely not at his best after the Chinese international had his clearance blocked into the net by Davidson. In the second half, Xie Pengfei and Zhang Xiaobin both scored to make it 4-0. Guangzhou were reduced to 10 men in the 73rd minute when Wu Shaocong received his second yellow and was sent off for bringing down Luo Senwen on the edge of the area. Stanciu scored his second of the match from the resulting free-kick, and Marcao completed the 6-0 rout in the 84th. Guangzhou are now at the bottom of the standings in the Dalian region after two rounds. The team, formerly known as Evergrande, had won seven straight Super League titles from 2011 to 2017 and their eighth in 2019. But they paid the price for losing most of their star players due to lack of financial support from the Evergrande Group at the end of last year. The 6-0 loss against Wuhan also equals their worst defeat in the club's history, as they were beaten by the same score by Changchun Yatai in 2008. Elsewhere, Felicio Brown Forbes scored two goals to lead Wuhan Yangtze River to a 2-1 victory over Hebei FC, and Zhejiang FC drew 0-0 with Changchun Yatai.
