Tsang Yi from Hong Kong, who was born in the 1990s, founded a hackerspace company in Shenzhen. With the concept of "it's better to teach a man to fish than giving him fish," Tsang aims to guide and inspire Hong Kong youths and help them realize their dreams in the Greater Bay Area. "Young people in Hong Kong can't be confined to Hong Kong. We'd better have a whole picture of our motherland," he said.
