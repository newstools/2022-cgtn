The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Monday reiterated that the Taiwan question fundamentally differs in nature from the Ukraine issue, adding Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory and the Taiwan question is purely China's internal affair that brooks no foreign interference. Spokesperson Wang Wenbin made the remarks at a regular press conference when asked to comment on Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's remarks at the Shangri-La Dialogue. When asked how the Taiwan region should respond if China "seeks to take it, by force if necessary," Zelenskyy on Saturday said that "today's example of Ukraine is an example for the whole world; no one benefits from war; if there is a way out diplomatically, we need to use the diplomatic way, but it must be a pre-emptive way, not the one that comes after the war has started." "We have noted that President Zelenskyy didn't mention Taiwan," Wang stressed, adding "as some media pointed out, some people are simply raising the questions about Taiwan in order to try to put words in President Zelenskyy's mouth." He added the country will take strong measures to respond to all "Taiwan independence" attempts aimed at splitting China in order to firmly defend national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
