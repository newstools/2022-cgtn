Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, gave a royal welcome to the opening day of Royal Ascot on Tuesday. The Royal Family members delighted spectators who had gathered to watch the Royal procession. The Queen Elizabeth was missing from the opening day of Britain's most popular horse racing event. Royal Ascot is part of an English sporting summer tradition where the cream of society dresses up to attend a series of events, including Wimbledon, Henley (Rowing) and Royal Ascot. The outfits on view ranged from the eccentric to the ravishingly beautiful. Royal Ascot draws to a close on Saturday. (With input from AP)
