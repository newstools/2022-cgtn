The death toll from a huge ongoing fire at a shipping container depot in Bangladesh hit 25 on Sunday and was expected to rise further, a senior health official said. "Twenty-five people have died in the fire including five firefighters. The death toll is expected to increase as the fire is still not totally under control," Health Department Director Hasan Shahriar told AFP.
