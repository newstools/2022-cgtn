Armed men killed at least 100 civilians in a rural district of northern Burkina Faso over the weekend, sources said on Monday. The attackers struck on the night between Saturday and Sunday in Seytenga commune, part of Seno province, which lies in borderlands where militants linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State are waging an insurgency. One security source told Reuters at least 100 people were killed. The local source, who did not wish to be named, informed the provisional death toll stood at 165. The United Nations condemned the attack that "claimed many victims" in a statement on Monday and called on authorities to bring perpetrators to justice.
