At least one person was killed following a missile strike in Kyiv's central Shevchenkivskiy district on Sunday morning, Ukrainian media Ukrayinska Pravda reported, citing Ukraine's Deputy Minister of Internal Affairs Anton Gerashchenko. The strike partially destroyed a nine-storey apartment building and caused a fire, the city's mayor Vitali Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. "There are people under the rubble," Klitschko said, adding that several people had already been hospitalized. "They (the rescuers) have pulled out a seven-year-old girl. She is alive. Now they're trying to rescue her mother." The head of Ukraine's police force Ihor Klymenko said in a separate comment that at least five people were wounded when the missile hit a building in central Kyiv, Reuters reported. Life had been returning to normal in Kyiv after fierce resistance held off Russian advances in the early phase of the conflict, although air raid sirens regularly sound across the city. There had been no major strikes on Kyiv since early June. The key eastern battlefield city of Sievierodonetsk fell to pro-Russian forces on Saturday after Ukrainian troops retreated, saying there was no longer anything to defend in the ruined city after months of fierce fighting. Calling for both sides to negotiate a peace deal to ensure global food supplies, Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Sunday said he will urge his Russian and Ukrainian counterparts to start a dialogue during a peace-building mission to both countries next week.
