The German Bundesrat approved a 100 billion euro ($107.2 billion) special defense fund on Saturday. The money is intended to strengthen Germany's military by topping up the existing annual defense budget of around 50 billion euros over several years. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the special fund is "the right answer to the turning point in history."
