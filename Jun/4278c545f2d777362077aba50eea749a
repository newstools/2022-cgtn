In a high-profile meeting on the sidelines of a key Asia security summit in Singapore on Friday, Chinese Defense Minister Wei Fenghe and U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin met for their first face-to-face talks since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January 2021. Wei and his U.S. counterpart are scheduled to give separate speeches on their own country's stances on the regional security architecture during the 19th Shangri-La Dialogue, a three-day summit from Friday to Sunday after a two-year suspension due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The U.S. will not miss the opportunity to explore the summit to push its agenda of the so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy, according to Tan Zhu, runner of Yuyuan Tantian, a social media account that comments on current international affairs. He said, the dialogue comes only weeks after the Biden administration unveiled its approach to China that can be described as "aligning" to "shape the strategic environment around Beijing." However, Tan warned that, given the complex international situation today, the United States need to think through the price it will pay if it intends to stir trouble in the Asia-Pacific region where peace and development prevail.
