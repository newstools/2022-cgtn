Chinese President Xi Jinping stressed the promotion of innovation and development of more high-tech companies in different fields during his visit in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Xi went to the cities of Meishan and Yibin on Wednesday and visited the local firm XGIMI Optoelectronic, learning about its independent innovation, job creation and local efforts to support the private sector. While there he also stressed forging clusters of innovative entities. In talks with employees of XGIMI, Xi encouraged them to address challenges in developing China into a manufacturing powerhouse. Xi's concern for the private sector is a long time coming. Back when he was the Party chief of Fuzhou City in the 1990s and later the Party chief of Zhejiang Province, he sought to help tackle difficulties for individual firms, even advising an entrepreneur to find him at his office if anything important came up. It was thus no lip service when Xi said "private enterprises and private entrepreneurs belong to our own family" while presiding over a symposium on private enterprises in November 2018. Xi stressed that the private economy is an essential element of China's economic system and pledged to unswervingly encourage, support and guide the development of the non-public sector. "All private companies and private entrepreneurs should feel totally reassured and devote themselves to seeking development," Xi said. (With inputs from Xinhua)
