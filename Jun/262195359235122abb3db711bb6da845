Chinese diver Wang Zongyuan claimed his second gold medal at the 19th International Swimming Federation (FINA) World Championships in the men's 3m springboard on Tuesday, with compatriot Cao Yuan finishing 2nd. Later in the men's 10m synchronized, Yang Hao and Lian Junjie added another gold for China. Wang and Cao won the men's 3m synchronized three days ago, clinching Team China's first gold in diving events this time. Wang took the lead on Tuesday after his first dive, and finished 1st with 561.95 points. "During the competition, I only focused on my own dives. You shouldn't think about others' points or the changes in the ranks. All you have to do is to think about the technical things and dive one by one. This was what I did in the match," Wang said after the final. Later on Tuesday, Yang and Lian collected 467.79 points in the men's 10m synchronized to secure China's fourth gold from the diving discipline in Budapest. "The Chinese team failed to secure the gold in this event at Tokyo Olympics, so we are happy that this time we won it back," Yang said. Team China have taken four victories from diving events in Budapest, including the men's 3m synchronized, women's 10m platform, as well as the two events on Tuesday. (With input from Xinhua)
