As a developing country, China is willing to work with all parties to deepen pragmatic cooperation in all areas, join hands in promoting the Global Development Initiative and make a positive contribution to speeding up the implementation of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Spokesperson of Chinese Foreign Ministry Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday at a regular briefing in Beijing. On Monday, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi delivered a statement via video link at a press conference during which the Global Development Report was released. The report aims to build a global community of development, according to the Center for International Knowledge on Development which compiled the document. The foreign minister pointed out that development issues are getting increasingly marginalized on the international agenda and it is not optimistic for the world to achieve sustainable development goals on schedule. The spokesperson said that the report, based on the experience accumulated by China and other countries around the world, puts forward policy recommendations for implementing the UN 2030 Agenda in eight aspects. All participants at Monday's launch spoke highly of the Global Development Initiative and believed it reflected the common aspiration of developing countries, and appreciated the report, the spokesperson said. China attaches great importance to development and will hold a high-level dialogue on global development this week, he added.
