U.S. President Joe Biden met with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Sunday at the G7 summit, as the three-day gathering kicked off in the Bavarian Alps against the backdrop of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. Biden thanked Scholz for his leadership in response to the Ukraine crisis by saying, "I want to compliment you on stepping up as you did when you became Chancellor." "Putin's being counting on it from the beginning, that somehow NATO and the G7 would splinter, but we haven't and it's not going to," Biden added. A senior US official said Washington has been "investing very heavily" in the relationship with Germany since Biden took office almost two and a half years ago. Their talks Sunday were "a good opportunity to affirm the deep and enduring ties between our two countries. In terms of the meeting agenda, expect that Russia and Ukraine are going to be at the top of the list, including our continued close coordination on the political and diplomatic front," the official said.
