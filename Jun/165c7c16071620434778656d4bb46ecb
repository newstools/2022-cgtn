The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed the country's first major gun control legislation in decades, approving a narrow package of new firearms restrictions and billions of dollars in mental health and school security funding. It will next go for approval to the House of Representatives, where Democrats have a majority and it is expected to pass despite House Republicans instructing their members to oppose it. "This is not a cure-all for the ways gun violence affects our nation, but it is a long overdue step in the right direction," Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the floor ahead of the vote.
