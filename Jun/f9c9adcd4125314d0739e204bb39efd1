U.S. President Joe Biden "does not agree with" proposals to expand the Supreme Court, White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Saturday aboard Air Force One en route to Munich, Germany.Some Democrats have called for adding seats to the court, which currently has a 6-3 conservative majority, after it overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that recognized a woman's constitutional right to an abortion and legalized it nationwide.
