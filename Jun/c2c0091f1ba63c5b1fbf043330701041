Former world No.1 and world champion Mohamed ElShorbagy notched up his first victory as an England player on Wednesday in the second round of the Mauritius Open in Grand Baie. The 31-year-old overcame the challenge of new compatriot James Willstrop in straight games, 11-8, 11-6, 11-5, in 32 minutes to move through to the last eight of the tournament. This was ElShorbagy's first competitive outing since changing his allegiance from Egypt to England earlier in the week. Another former world champion and No.1, Gregory Gaultier of France, took his final bow on the PSA World Tour after losing out to Egypt's Mazen Hesham. The 39-year-old Frenchman Gaultier took the opening game, but ultimately went down 3-1, 12-14, 11-2, 11-3, 11-6 in 41 minutes and there was a warm embrace from Hesham and huge cheers from the crowd as the three-time British Open winner walked off court and into retirement.
