Tennis greats Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal kick-started their Wimbledon preparations with exhibition wins at the Giorgio Armani Tennis Classic on Wednesday. Djokovic, in his first match since losing to Nadal in the quarter-finals at Roland Garros, won, 6-2, 6-1 against Canada's Felix Auger-Aliassime. The Serbian world No.3 broke the Canadian twice to take the first set 6-2 in 44 minutes. Auger-Aliassime failed to trouble Djokovic's serve in the second set and was broken three more times as the six-time Wimbledon winner wrapped it up 6-1 in 28 minutes. The 20-time grand slam champion Djokovic will pursue his seventh title at The Championships, where he owns a 79-10 record. The Serbian has won 21 consecutive matches at the tournament, having emerged victorious at the past three editions of the event. Meanwhile, Nadal showed no ill-effects after nerve treatment on the chronic foot problem that troubled him during his French Open triumph earlier this month as he beat Stan Wawrinka 6-2 6-3 in his first match on grass since 2019. Nadal has won the first two majors of the season at the Australian Open and Roland Garros. The Spaniard will try to complete the third step of the Grand Slam at Wimbledon, where he has lifted the trophy twice, in 2008 and 2010. "Since 2019 I haven't been able to play on grass through the tough moments we went through with the pandemic and last year I got injured. So I am excited to be back where we are today. It has always been a pleasure playing here in Hurlingham. It is special to be back." said Nadal. (With input from AP and ATP)
