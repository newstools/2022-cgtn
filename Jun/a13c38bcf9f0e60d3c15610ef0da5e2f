Iga Swiatek of Poland beat Cori Gauff of the U.S. 2-0 (6-1, 6-3) in the French Open women's singles final at Roland Garros in Paris on Saturday to win her second Grand Slam title. With her 35th straight win, Swiatek beat the second-longest winning streak record since 2000 kept by Serena Williams of the U.S. As the world's No. 1, Swiatek almost swept Gauff in the first set, leaving her opponent no chance to score a break. Gauff's counter-attack happened in the second set and she won the first two games. However, Swiatek responded with even more fierce offense, claiming five straight games. She had the chance to end the competition in the eighth game, but Gauff survived it with her resilient performance and kept the final match a live. The little suspense didn't last long and eventually Swiatek proceeded to win the last game.
