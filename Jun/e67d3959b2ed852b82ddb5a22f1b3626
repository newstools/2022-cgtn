Moscow has warned that European consumers will be the first to suffer from sanctions on Russian oil imports. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said there may be a "big deficit" of oil products in the EU. The Russian foreign ministry said the bloc's decisions to partially phase out Russian oil and oil products will lead to further price rises. And it said these sanctions are highly likely to destabilize energy markets and disrupt supply chains.
