The first edition of China Documentary Festival, jointly organized by China Media Group and China's Ministry of Culture and Tourism, kicked off on June 21 in Beijing. Over 50 documentaries and feature films produced by CGTN in English, Spanish, French, Arabic and Russian languages, including many award-winning works, will be showcased across hundreds of media platforms around the world. Shen Haixiong, President of the China Media Group, said in his speech that having more than 50 feature films to introduce China is like a colorful kaleidoscope, sharing with a global audience the stories of ordinary Chinese people pursuing and realizing their dreams, and providing a window to China through the daily lives of its 1.4 billion people.
