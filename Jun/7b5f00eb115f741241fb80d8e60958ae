China's sci-tech museums have been visited by over 850 million people in the past 10 years, officials said on Thursday. China created its modern sci-tech museum system, with mobile, digital and traditional museums as well as science caravans, in 2012. The number of museums across the country is now 408, compared to 118 in 2012.  Number of mobile museums reached 612. More than 1,200 science caravans have travelled a total of 50 million kilometers to spread knowledge to the people, while a total of 1,112 popular-science sites have been built in rural middle schools. More than 15 million people experienced sci-tech museums through digital media, which is 70 times more than that of a decade ago. China promotes popular science and is continuing to put a lot of effort into educating the people both online and offline.
