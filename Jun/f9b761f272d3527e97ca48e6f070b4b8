The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Thursday urged the United States to revoke its latest round of arms sales to the Taiwan region. The U.S. has approved a $120 million sale of ship parts to the Taiwan region. The U.S. arms sales to Taiwan is a serious violation of the one-China principle and the provisions of the three China-U.S. joint communiques, especially the August 17 Communique, said Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry at a regular press conference in Beijing. The arms sales will undermine China's security interests, and damage China-U.S. relations and peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Zhao said. "China resolutely opposes and strongly condemns this." The U.S. side should abide by the one-China principle and the provisions of the three joint communiques, he said, urging it to revoke the sales and stop military ties with the Taiwan region. The U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency said on Wednesday in a statement that it had delivered the required certification notifying Congress following the State Department's approval of the sale of ship spare parts, ship system spare parts and related equipment for an estimated cost of $120 million to the Taiwan region. This will be the fourth U.S. arms sale to the Taiwan region since U.S. President Joe Biden took office in January 2021 and the third one this year. China has criticized the U.S. side for hollowing out the one-China principle it has committed itself to. (Cover: File of Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. /VCG)
