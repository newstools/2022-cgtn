The World Trade Organization (WTO) approved a package of trade deals at the 12th Ministerial Conference (MC12) in Geneva early Friday morning. The agreements include responses to food insecurity and the COVID-19 pandemic, World Food Program purchase exemptions, extension of a moratorium on e-commerce, and fisheries subsidies. "Not in a long while has the WTO seen such a significant number of multilateral outcomes," WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said.
