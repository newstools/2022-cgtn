Emma Raducanu is expected to be fit to play at Wimbledon this year following her withdrawal from a grass-court event in Nottingham on Tuesday. Raducanu needed a medical timeout in the early stages of her clash with Switzerland's Viktorija Golubic after suffering a problem to her left side as her injury problems continue. The US Open champion received treatment and took painkillers in an attempt to carry on, but had to pull out of the match trailing 4-3 in the first set - the third time she has had to do so since winning the US Open in September. The 19 year-old British has been advised to rest and will miss next week's tournament in Birmingham, but is expected to turn out at Eastbourne the following week. Raducanu, who reached the last-16 at Wimbledon last year, also lamented the string of fitness issues she's struggled with since winning her maiden grand slam. The teenager has not made it past the quarter-finals in any of the tournaments she has featured in since Flushing Meadows and her most recent results have been a collection of first and second round defeats. The current world No.11 has been unable to find consistency since her breakthrough year and is currently without a coach. (With input from AP)
