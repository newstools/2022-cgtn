Four explosions were heard in Kyiv on Sunday as air raid sirens sounded across Ukraine, according to CMG reporters. Ukrainian news agency UNIAN said one person has died as a result of the "Russian missile attack." Emergency services said a nine-story residential building had been partially damaged in the attack. Kyiv's mayor, Vitali Klitschko, said residents are being rescued and evacuated from two buildings. "There are people under the rubble," Klitschko said on the Telegram messaging app. He said several people had already been hospitalized. Local broadcaster Ukraine 24 claimed that 14 missiles were fired in the region. Russia has not responded to the claims. (With input from Reuters)
