The second part of the COP15 meeting of the Convention on Biological Diversity will be relocated to Montreal, Canada, from December 5 to 17, China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment confirmed on Tuesday. The first part took place in Kunming, the capital of southwest China's Yunnan Province, in October 2021, with some activities held online. The decision to change venues was taken as a result of the current COVID-19 situation after consultations among the Chinese and Canadian governments and the conference Secretariat, the ministry said. It said China would continue to lead the substantive and political affairs of the conference as the president of COP15. The COP15 theme and logo will remain unchanged.
