For Australia, Monday's World Cup qualification playoff against the United Arab Emirates marks the first of two steps towards a place at a fifth straight World Cup finals. For the UAE, it's a chance to get one match closer to their first appearance since their debut in 1990. Whoever wins the showdown in Al Rayyan, Qatar, will take on Peru in a final playoff at the same Ahmad bin Ali Stadium on June 14 to decide who will line up alongside France, Denmark and Tunisia in Group D at Qatar 2022. "Australia's pretty much used to doing it the hard way," Australia head coach Graham Arnold said as he looked ahead to Tuesday. "It's our fifth time we've had to go through playoffs and so it's an experience that we're used to." "We all know what's at stake, and they know what's at stake also," Aussie forward Mitchell Duke said. "So, we've got to expect a big fight, a physical battle. And who wants it more will come out on top." (With input from AP)
