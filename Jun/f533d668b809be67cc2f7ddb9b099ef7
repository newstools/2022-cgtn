Germany's Manuel Lettenbichler won the 26th edition of the Erzbergrodeo off-road motorcycle race in Eisernerz, Austria on Sunday, following the trail of his father Andreas, who won the event seven years earlier. Lettenbichler overcame a field of 500 enduro riders from across the world, and was one of only eight competitors to complete the 35.2-kilometre course - split into 27 sections - inside the four-hour time limit. The race was held on and around Erzberg Mountain - a functioning mine in Southern Austria which produces more than two-million tonnes of iron ore per year. (With input from AP)
