EU energy ministers agreed on Monday to increase the share of renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, to 40 percent in the bloc's overall energy mix by 2030. The energy ministers meeting in Luxembourg also agreed to reduce the EU's total energy consumption by at least 9 percent by 2030 as compared to the 2020 figure. The agreement will now be negotiated with the European Parliament, which has yet to finalize its position on the target. The target, which was previously set at 32 percent, is part of the EU's ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent by 2030. This would set the path towards achieving net zero carbon emissions in Europe by 2050. (With input from AFP)
