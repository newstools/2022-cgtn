A leopard cat was captured by an infrared camera this June for the first time in Hainan Changjiang Haiwei National Wetland Park in south China's Hainan Province. The leopard cat is about the size of a domestic cat, but more slender, with longer legs. It lives in forested areas and is rarely seen during the day. The species is now under second-class state protection in China. (Cover image via screenshot.) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
