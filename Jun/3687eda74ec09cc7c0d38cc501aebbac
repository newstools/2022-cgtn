More than two years have passed since the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Every time a city sees a resurgence of COVID-19 infections, the catering industry is among the hardest hit. Hubei, China's largest production base for crayfish, a favored summer delicacy for Chinese diners, has suffered from the latest outbreaks in major cities, including Shanghai. But thanks to policies and measures to help stimulate businesses, recovery began quickly in this sector. Many say that China's quick response to COVID-19 provides a good foundation for an economic recovery.
