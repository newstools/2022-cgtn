Reports say Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's visit to Serbia has been canceled after countries around Serbia closed their airspace. A Serbian media report says Bulgaria, North Macedonia and Montenegro blocked off Lavrov's access by closing their airspace. Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova has responded to the closure, saying the move has blocked another channel of communication.
