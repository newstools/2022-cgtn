Arsenal have confirmed Alexandre Lacazette will leave the Gunners this summer. The 31-year-old will quit the north London club when his contract expires on June 30, with a free-transfer return to former club Lyon expected to be his next destination. Lyon General Manager Vincent Ponsot said: "He is a player who interests us for all that he has represented here. We noticed his maturity and he is someone that the club have stayed in contact with." Lacazette joined the Gunners in 2017 for a then club-record fee of £46.5 million. The Frenchman made an instant impact, scoring just 94 seconds into his Premier League debut in a 4-3 win over Leicester City. His best season in an Arsenal shirt came in the 2018-2019 season with him named Supporters' Player of the Season after scoring 13 Premier League goals, one less than his best output in that of his debut season. The forward struck 71 goals in 206 appearances in five years at the Emirates Stadium. In the past campaign, he could only score four times, but provided seven assists. Arsenal have been heavily linked with a move for Manchester City's Gabriel Jesus, and Lacazette's departure opens up a spot in Mikel Arteta's squad. Everton's Dominic Calvert-Lewin is also said to be on their radar. (With input from AP)
