The LIV Golf Invitational will arrive on U.S. soil this week for its second event in Portland, Oregon. The Saudi-backed series has added four players from the top 50 in the world since the inaugural event outside London – Brooks Koepka, Abraham Ancer, Bryson DeChambeau and Patrick Reed. Four-time major winner Rory McIlroy has labeled the players who have joined the LIV series "duplicitous" for the way they have handled their breakaway. (With input from AP)
