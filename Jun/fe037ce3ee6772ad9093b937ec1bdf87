Alfalfa, known as the "king of forage grass," is widely grown in north China's Shanxi Province. Farmers in Huairen City have planted 800 hectares of alfalfa this year. Alfalfa has four harvest seasons and Huairen City has started its first season of the year. Agricultural machinery has been working more than 10 hours a day. Reaping has to be finished before purple flowers blossom to ensure high-quality forage. Local farmers say they have a better harvest this year, thanks to the rain and snow in spring.
