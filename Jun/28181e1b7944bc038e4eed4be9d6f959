World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala warned of food crisis due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict at the organization's 12th Ministerial Conference on June 12. She said that droughts, floods, heatwaves and other extreme weather events combined with COVID-19 pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks have led to rising food prices around the world, and the WTO must respond to a looming food crisis.
