The refilling of water into all dried-out sections of the Beijing-Hangzhou Grand Canal has been completed, enabling the full connection of the waterway for the first time in over a century. With a history of more than 2,500 years, the canal connects Beijing in the north and Hangzhou of Zhejiang Province in the south, having served as a significant transportation artery in ancient China.
