U.S. President Joe Biden is facing criticism for failing to invite certain nations to the Summit of the Americas event. The Biden administration says the decision is due to ideological discord, particularly in the name of democracy and human rights concerns. Leaders from several countries including Mexico, Bolivia, Guatemala and some Caribbean countries have threatened to boycott the summit. A Nicaraguan official voiced strong condemnation against the U.S.'s exclusion.
