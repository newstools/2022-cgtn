Four-time grand slam champion Naomi Osaka has withdrawn from this year's Wimbledon Championships, citing an ongoing Achilles injury. "My Achilles still isn't right so I'll see you next time," the 24 year-old Japanese player announced on social media on Saturday. Osaka has not played since her first round exit at the French Open and although she was on the provisional list of players published by Wimbledon organizers last week, she has not appeared at any of the regular warm-up grass court tournaments. Speaking after her defeat at Roland Garros in May, the four-time grand slam winner cast doubt on her participation at the All England Club because the ATP and WTA had stripped the tournament of ranking points. Osaka's best Wimbledon showings are third-round losses to Wimbledon champions in both 2017 and 2018. In 2017, she fell to five-time Wimbledon champion Venus Williams, while in 2018 she was defeated by eventual champion Angelique Kerber. The former world No.1 saw her ranking dip to No.85 earlier this year but has risen back inside the Top 50 after a run to the Miami Open final in March, where she fell to World No.1 Iga Swiatek. Canada's former Wimbledon runner-up Eugenie Bouchard also withdrew from the tournament on Saturday because of the lack of ranking points. (With input from AP)
