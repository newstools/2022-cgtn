Coco Gauff reached her first Grand Slam semi-final at the French Open on Tuesday when she defeated fellow American Sloane Stephens. Gauff, 18, who ranks 23 in the world, triumphed 7-5, 6-2. She will face Italy's 59th-ranked Martina Trevisan for a place in Saturday's championship match. "Last time I played Sloane I lost. Today was different. I stayed mentally strong as she is the kind of player who can make shots others can't do," said Gauff. A few hours after clinching her singles semi-final spot, she also booked a place in the quarters of the women's doubles with Jessica Pegula. The busy schedule, however, will not affect her performance, having played as many as three matches a day during her junior career. Gauff was junior champion at Roland Garros in 2018 and then burst into the public consciousness at the age of 15, when she became the youngest woman to qualify for Wimbledon. Her profile rocketed when she went all the way to the fourth round at the All England Club, knocking out Venus Williams on the way. (With input from agencies)
