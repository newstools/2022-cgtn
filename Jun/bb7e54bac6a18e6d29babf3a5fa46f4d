Rick Kimberley is an American farmer who operates two agricultural ventures in China. He traces the decision to launch these operations to a day in February 2012, when his farm in Iowa received an important Chinese visitor, Xi Jinping. Impressed by the then-Vice President's friendliness and knowledge of farming, Kimberley was convinced that China was a place where he could do business.
