Some 13,000 newly unearthed cultural relics have been discovered from six pits in the new round of excavation work at China's ancient ruins site Sanxingdui. The Sichuan Provincial Cultural Relics and Archaeology Research Institute held a press conference at the Sanxingdui Museum on Monday to announce the results of archaeological excavation at the Sanxingdui site, a major project of "Archaeological China."

The sacrificial area includes the No. 1 pit, No. 2 pit excavated in 1986 and the six pits newly discovered between 2020 and 2022. The eight pits are surrounded by rectangular trenches, small circular and rectangular sacrificial pits, as well as trenches in the south and buildings in the northwest. Nearly 13,000 cultural relics were unearthed from the six pits, including 3,155 relatively complete ones. As of May 2022, field excavations of pits numbered K3, K4, K5 and K6 have been completed, among which K3 and K4 have entered the finishing stage, K5 and K6 are undergoing laboratory archaeological cleaning, and K7 and K8 are in the extraction stage of buried cultural relics.
