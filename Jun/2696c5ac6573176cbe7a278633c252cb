U.S. Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer said on Wednesday that he will officially step down from the bench at noon Thursday. Breyer, who has served as an associate justice of the Supreme Court since 1994, made the announcement in a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden. The 83-year-old liberal announced his retirement from the court earlier this year. He will be replaced by 51-year-old Ketanji Brown Jackson.
