Italy trained at Molineux on Friday ahead of their UEFA Nations League match against England this weekend. Roberto Mancini's side sit top of Group A3 after a win over Hungary and a draw with Germany in their opening two fixtures. The meeting between the two sides is a repeat of the Euro 2020 final when Italy won on penalties and lifted the trophy. But the Italians have struggled after the continental showpiece, even losing 1-0 against North Macedonia in the World Cup Qualification playoff. Mancini's side were then defeated 3-0 in the 2022 Finalissima final by Argentina. When asked whether England will look to gain some revenge for the result last summer, Mancini said, "Maybe, but it will be a different game. We play here, and we will play behind closed doors. It will be a different game." The Italy coach added that he wished the match was being played in front of supporters at Molineux stadium in the central English city of Wolverhampton. The English FA was given a two-match stadium ban, one of which was suspended, following the unrest at the final at Wembley last year. (With input from AP)
