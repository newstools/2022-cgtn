The world faces an "ocean emergency" and the tide must be turned as healthy and productive oceans would be vital for a shared future, said United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Speaking at the 2022 UN Ocean Conference, which began on June 27 in Lisbon, Guterres noted that the world has seen some progress in marine protection since the last conference held five years ago but more work remains.He made proposals in several areas, including investing in sustainable oceanic economy and climate change-tailored seaside infrastructures, and introducing more technical innovation to promote global maritime actions.
