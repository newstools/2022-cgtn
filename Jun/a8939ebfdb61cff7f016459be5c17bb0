China is capable of detecting potentially imported cases of monkeypox in a timely manner by conducting nucleic acid testing and following up on clinical specimens of suspected cases, said Xu Wenbo, head of the National Institute for Viral Disease Control and Prevention under the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, on Thursday. More than 1,000 cases of monkeypox have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 29 non-endemic countries, Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a news briefing on Wednesday.
