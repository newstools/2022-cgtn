The latest proposal is a price cap on Russian oil, which is already subject to Western sanctions and a European embargo. But few details have been released about the plan. The G7 has pledged more than $4 billion to improve global food security but is not easing sanctions on Russia. Einar Tangen, a political and economic affairs commentator, shares his views on the issue.
