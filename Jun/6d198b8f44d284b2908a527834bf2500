The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that there is no constitutional right to abortion, upending the landmark Roe vs Wade case from nearly 50 years ago. Anti-abortion activists cheered for the ruling, while pro-choice protests erupted in major cities such as Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, New York and Boston. U.S. President Joe Biden called the ruling a "sad day for the court and the country."
