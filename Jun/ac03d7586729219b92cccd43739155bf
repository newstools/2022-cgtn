Portugal trained on Wednesday ahead of their UEFA Nations League group game against the Czech Republic. The 2019 winners will face the Czechs on Thursday at the Estadio Jose Alvalade in Lisbon. After five games and nearly nine months without an international goal, Cristiano Ronaldo scored his world record-extending 116th and 117th goals in a 4-0 rout against Switzerland in the Nations League on Sunday. Portugal lead Group A2 with four points after drawing 1-1 against Spain last Thursday, while the Czech Republic also have four points but are behind on goal difference. The Czech Republic squad also trained on Wednesday. The East Europeans opened their campaign with a 2-1 win over Switzerland on June 2 and followed that up with a 2-2 draw against Spain three days later. Lokomotiv Moscow forward Jan Kuchta has been their form player so far, with two goals and an assist. However, the Czechs have injury worries as left-back Jaroslav Zeleny and replacement Jakub Jankto are both out. Bayer Leverkusen's promising forward Adam Hlozek may lead the attack, with West Ham's Tomas Soucek in midfield. "Portugal will be a tough opponent tomorrow, but I believe we will perform as we did in the last two matches against Switzerland and Spain and that we will be successful," said Jaroslav Silhavy, the Czech Republic manager. "It would be better if Ronaldo didn't play but looking at the sporting side of it, Ronaldo is an attraction, and the players want to play against him. They will be happy to measure and compare their strengths against him. We know he is a great player who decides matches and I hope he will be on the pitch." (With input from AP)
