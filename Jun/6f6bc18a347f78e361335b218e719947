Fresh progress has been made in a research and restoration project being conducted on the Great Wall by the Beijing municipal government on its Dazhuangke section. The project is based on an archaeological assessment of the Great Wall's architectural, structural and technological uniqueness, its erosion and gradual disintegration, and the environment in which it was built. The next step will be further conservation work through digital tracking and other techniques.
