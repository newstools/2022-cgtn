Firefighters saved a 6-year-old boy trapped down a 40-meter-deep well in northern China. A video filmed in the city of Langfang in Hebei Province shows two firefighters using a tool to break the wall and free the boy trapped inside the well. According to reports, the boy accidentally fell into the water well while playing in a yard. Villagers used excavators to dig the mud away from the well before rescuers arrived. It took the rescuers approximately 15 minutes to free the child and hand him over to the paramedics. The child was not injured seriously.
