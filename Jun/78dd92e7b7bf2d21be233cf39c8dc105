A day after his historic victory, 14-times French Open champion Rafael Nadal of Spain lifted up the Musketeers' cup again for a photo shoot by the river Seine. With the Eiffel Tower in the background and the sun bouncing off gold touches of nearby statues, the setting was so perfect that even Nadal took selfies. On bridge Alexander III, a crowd of passersby quickly gathered to cheer and clap the champion. It is the first time Nadal has won the Australian Open and Roland Garros in the same season. Earlier this year, the 36-year-old Spaniard captured his second trophy at Melbourne Park. Title winners since 1891 are inscribed on the trophy's base with Nadal's name featured a staggering fourteen times – more than any other player. The king of clay is now 14-0 in Roland Garros finals. No other man has more than six titles at the tournament. The 22-time major winner is now the oldest men's singles champion in Roland Garros' history. Nadal broke the mark previously set by Andres Gimeno, who was 34 years, 10 months when he was victorious in 1972. (With input from AP)
