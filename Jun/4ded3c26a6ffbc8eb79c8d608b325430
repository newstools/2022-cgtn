Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi met with his counterparts from Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan, respectively, on the sidelines of the third China+Central Asia (C+C5) foreign ministers' meeting in Kazakhstan on Tuesday, where Wang vowed that China would boost ties with Central Asian countries. Energy is an important part of China's strategic cooperation with Turkmenistan, Wang told Turkmen Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Rashid Meredov. No matter how the international situation changes, China's intention to expand energy cooperation between the two sides remains the same, the Chinese diplomat said. Meanwhile, Wang and Uzbekistan's acting Foreign Minister Vladimir Norov agreed that their countries would facilitate interconnection and the combined transportation of road and rail. Wang also hailed China's friendship with Kyrgyzstan as this year marks the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between the countries. During a conversation with Foreign Minister Jeenbek Kulubaev, Wang said China would take the anniversary as an opportunity to further develop its ties with Kyrgyzstan.
