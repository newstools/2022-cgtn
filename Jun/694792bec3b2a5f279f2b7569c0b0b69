Unlike snow, which occurs primarily in winter, hail frequently happens during spring and summer. When the chunks of ice, or hailstones, fall to the ground, they can damage crops, buildings or even people. Certain parts of China experience more hail than others. The China Meteorological Administration (CMA) has analyzed the data and ranked the cities more prone to hailstorms. Check out the video to learn more.
