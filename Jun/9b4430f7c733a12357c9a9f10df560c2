Getting instant images and data throughout space launch missions is very important for the launch to be successful. This job is done through coordination of various tracking and monitoring stations. At the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center where the Shenzhou-14 manned space craft is scheduled for lift-off in June, CGTN reporter Zheng Yibing visited a station equipped with multiple types of devices, like the optical telescope. "We are mainly responsible for tracking live images during space missions, like target detection of the carrier rocket and the measurement of its position in space," said engineer Yu Shilong. The system that he works on requires great skill and precise mechanisms. "We did lots of training before and after we got this job. That's the only way to learn to conduct stable tracking of a flying object," Yu said. Many are working with him as the team has a long history in serving the Shenzhou missions. "Our devices are specifically used for manned missions. We've done this in all previous Shenzhou missions, from the very first in the 1990s to the 13th that blasted off last year. And now, we are getting ready for the 14th," he said. In this station, there are multiple spots that are going to work together to track and monitor the Shenzhou-14 in flight and there is a command post there to coordinate them. "We collect data and images from various tracking spots here and gather information on working conditions of the devices used in them," said engineer Jia Jianglei. "All our tracking and monitoring data and images will be sent to the command center at the launch site. The information, in particular, the radar data, will guide other tracking and monitoring devices," he added. Jia said that these will be essential references for the command center for the whole mission to monitor and make decisions and responses to make the Shenzhou-14 manned mission a success.
