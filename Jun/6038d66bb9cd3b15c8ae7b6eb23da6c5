The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has found evidence of local transmission of monkeypox in the United States, in addition to reports of cases where people had traveled abroad. The cases are mainly occurring in men who have sex with men, but women are also getting infected, CDC staff member Dr Agam Rao said at a panel meeting on Thursday.
