Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday sent a message of condolence to Acting Foreign Minister of the Afghan Interim Government Amir Khan Muttaqi over the devastating recent earthquake in the country. Wang said he was shocked to learn that the earthquake, which struck southeastern Afghanistan, caused massive casualties. He expressed deep condolences to the victims and sincere sympathies to the bereaved families and the wounded. The Chinese foreign minister also expressed his belief that the Afghan people will overcome the disaster, and restore normal life and production at an early date. As a friendly neighbor, China is ready to do its best to provide emergency humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan in line with its needs, he said. According to the Chinese Foreign Ministry, the Chinese government will provide 50 million yuan (about $7.47 million) worth of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. Spokesperson Wang Wenbin said in a statement that the aid includes tents and quilts, among other assistance. The first batch of aid is scheduled to be sent by charter flight on Monday. China will work closely with the Afghan interim government to help the victims tide over difficulties, the spokesperson added. The spokesperson at Friday's regular press conference also told reporters that the grain assistance that China pledged previously had all arrived in Afghanistan recently. "It is being rapidly distributed to the local people and will help with Afghanistan’s response to the disaster." A magnitude-6.1 earthquake hit southeastern Afghanistan on Wednesday, leaving at least 1,500 people dead and over 3,000 homes destroyed. (With input from Xinhua)
