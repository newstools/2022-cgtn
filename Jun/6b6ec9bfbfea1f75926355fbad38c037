American blockbuster "Jurassic World Dominion," the sixth and reportedly final film in the Jurassic film franchise, made 263 million yuan ($39 million) June 13-19, dominating the weekly box office for the second consecutive week, according to Maoyan, China's top movie ticketing platform. The film's domestic box office hit 600 million yuan on its 10th day of release, invigorating the previously relatively sluggish summer movie market. The story picks up about four years after the eruption in Jurassic Park, with dinosaurs living and hunting with humans all over the world. However, despite its commercial success, "Jurassic World Dominion" received mediocre reviews, with a rating of 6.3 on Douban, a leading Chinese film review website. Domestic teenpic films "One Week Friends" and "My Blue Summer" grossed 38.8 million yuan and 24.1 million yuan, respectively, ranking second and third in the past week.  "One Week Friends" is an adaptation of the animation with the same name. The film tells the story of high school student Lin Xiangzhi, who has only one week of memory because of a car accident. She gets to know and be friends with her good friend Xu Youshu every week. The arrival of graduation season and summer vacation has brought increasing attention to youth campus movies. A series of high-profile films will be released next week, including tear-jerker family drama "Lighting Up the Stars." (Cover image designed by Feng Yuan)
