The New York Yankees reached a deal on Friday with their slugger Aaron Judge to avoid a salary arbitration hearing. "I knew it would work out one way or another," Judge said. "I really wasn't too concerned about what it was going to be. Just happy we were able to agree on a number, settle this thing, and not go into court there." ESPN reported that the team and player agreed over a one-year, $19 million contract with two add-ons of $250,000 if Judge is named the American League (AL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) and the World Series MVP. Moreover, he will become a free agent after the 2022 season. "Excited that that's behind us, and we can leave that portion of the show alone," Yankees manager Aaron Boone said. Judge turned down a seven-year, $213.5 million extension offer from the Yankees before the season had started. If he hits the free agency after the season, the team will have to go through intense competition to sign him. Though the two sides didn't reach a long-term extension during the offseason, the Yankees have been performing incredibly well this season with a league-leading 52-19 record. They have lost only four of the past 23 games. Judge has been in his best form as well. He hit a batting average of .304 and a slugging percentage of .658 for 53 runs batted in and 27 home runs with an on-base percentage of 37.9 in 68 games. He has a chance to become the first player in the MLB to bat 60 homers in over 20 years if he maintains such excellent form. "Glad we were able to get through that process," he said. "Took a little longer than expected but thankfully we're past it. Time to focus on winning some games."
