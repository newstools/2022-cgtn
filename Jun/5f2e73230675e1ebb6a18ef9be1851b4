American golfer Scottie Scheffler has set the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Tour record for most official money earned in a single season with $12,896,849 (does not include bonuses), PGA Tour Communications reported on Monday. As of May 2022, Scheffler is the world No. 1 golfer, and celebrates his 26th birthday on June 21. He took home $2.7 million for winning the 2022 Masters in April and earned $1,557,687 after taking the second prize at the U.S. Open in Brookline, Massachusetts on June 19. Moreover, Scheffler's season isn't finished. "It's his first major, but not his first PGA Tour win. In fact, Scheffler has been on something of a hot streak in 2022, winning four out of his last six tournaments entered and nearing $10 million won on the year. In total, Scheffler has won $10,098,014 since the start of the 2021-22 PGA Tournament calendar," sport writer Joe Rivera wrote on sportingnews.com in April.
