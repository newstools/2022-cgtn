Craig Mroczka, golf's DP World Tour's on-site meteorologist, is expecting a busy time at the BMW International Open near Munich, Germany, this week. It is his mission, however, to keep the event flowing and everyone safe from the dangers inclement weather can pose. While most on the DP World Tour wish for wall-to-wall sunshine, Mroczka admits that he enjoys dealing with a multitude of weather conditions. "I sort of hate the weeks where the weather is good because it's just sunny, sunny, sunny... you sort of feel bad, almost. But then there's always going to be weeks like this where, you know, it's crazy," Mroczka said. Having grown up in Connecticut, United States, Craig now applies his trade across the numerous stops of the DP World Tour. This isn't something he begrudges as the opportunity to combine his passions for weather and sport is an aspect of his job he very much enjoys. Weather conditions are a huge factor in the strategy and logistics of a golf tournament, from the players to the event organizers. (With input from AP)
