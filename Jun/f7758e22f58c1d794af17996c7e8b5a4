Nine staffers from the U.S. late-night comedy talk show "The Late Show with Stephen Colbert" were arrested by the U.S. Capitol Police after "they allegedly illegally entered a U.S. House of Representatives office building on Thursday night," Fox News reported. The group took videos and pictures near the offices of two Republican members of Congress, and had earlier been escorted out of the Jan. 6 committee hearing for not having proper press credentials, Fox News claimed, citing sources.
