Temperatures has risen again in parts of India after a brief spell of rain, giving residents who have been struggling to carry out their daily activities amid the scorching heat a tough time. With temperatures reaching as high as 43 degrees Celsius, people were forced to take shelter in order to avoid the scorching heat. India suffered its hottest March in more than 100 years, and parts of the country experienced their highest temperatures on record in April. Scientists have linked the early onset of an intense summer to climate change, and say that more than a billion people in India and neighboring Pakistan are in some way at risk from the extreme heat.
