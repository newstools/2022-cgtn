U.S.-listed China stocks soared Monday to the highest since early April, while the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index closed 5.4 percent higher following a surge of as much as 8.3 percent. Didi Global's American depositary receipts jumped 68 percent at the start of trading in New York, and then pared some gains and left them up over 24 percent from Friday's close. The surge in Didi's New York-listed shares came after a Wall Street Journal report saying that China was preparing to lift a ban on the ride-hailing app. Both Alibaba Group and JD.com advanced more than 6.2 percent. The global markets rose on Monday after China loosened some COVID-19 restrictions in Beijing, which has boosted investors' confidence. In May, Chinese Vice Premier Liu He called for support for the development of the platform economy and technology companies' stock listings.
