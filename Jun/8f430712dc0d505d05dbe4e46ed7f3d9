The China Manned Space Agency released on Saturday an 8K ultra-high-definition (UHD) video of some of the highlights of the Shenzhou-13 space mission. Chinese astronauts recorded the video aboard the Shenzhou-13 crewed spaceship during their six-month space station mission. China plans to send another crew of three astronauts to the Tianhe core module with the Shenzhou-14 crewed spacecraft for another six-month mission.
