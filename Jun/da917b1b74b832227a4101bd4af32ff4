A magnitude-6.1 earthquake rattled Lushan County at 5:00 p.m. on June 1, followed by a magnitude-4.5 shock three minutes later in nearby Baoxing County, both administrative districts of Ya'an City in southwest China's Sichuan Province. Rescue work continues in the earthquake-rattled area, and temporary shelters have also been set up at Taiping Middle School to relocate evacuated residents of Taiping Town in Lushan County. As of 9:00 a.m. on Thursday, four people had died and 41 others were left injured by the earthquakes. One CGTN stringer in Lushan County's Taiping Town sent exclusive footage from the scene, showing how the evacuated residents took shelter.
