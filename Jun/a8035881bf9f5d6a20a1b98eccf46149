The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region's Department of Justice will consolidate the city's successful role as a center for international arbitration and legal services, and cultivate more professionals, said Secretary for Justice Teresa Cheng. "I think the most important (factor) is people," Cheng told the media. "We have a number of international conferences on arbitration, international law, and mediation that will provide a very good learning platform for people. So, that is something we will continue to do." Cheng also hailed the establishment of the Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) Hong Kong Regional Arbitration Center, saying it will help the region reinforce its strength "as an international legal and dispute resolution center." The AALCO opened on May 25 with the support of the central government and will allow Hong Kong to promote its arbitration services beyond the Asia Pacific region, into African countries. Cheng noted that Hong Kong will also promote mediation agreements in the mainland and Macao, under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle. "We can explore options in the Greater Bay Area in three jurisdictions (Hong Kong, Macao, mainland) under the "One Country, Two Systems" principle. We can look at whether or not we can enforce our mediation agreements reached with each jurisdiction in the other two jurisdictions," she said.
