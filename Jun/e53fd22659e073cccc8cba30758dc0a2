American big names Lindsey Vonn, Michelle Kwan, Mia Hamm, Billie Jean King and the late Pat Summitt are among the nine individual women who were inducted into the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Hall of Fame Friday, along with Michael Phelps and hurdling great Roger Kingdom. Others voted onto the 2022 class on a crowded ballot were Natalie Coughlin (swimming), Muffy Davis (para Alpine skiing and cycling), David Kiley (para Alpine skiing, track and field and wheelchair basketball), Trischa Zorn-Hudson (para swimming) and Gretchen Fraser (skiing). The 1976 women's 4x100 freestyle relay swimming team, anchored by Shirley Babashoff in a stunning upset over the East Germans, and the 2002 men's Paralympic sled hockey team also were voted into the hall by a mix of Olympic and Paralympic athletes, journalists, administrators and fans. It is the first hall class since 2019, before which there hadn't been a class since 2012. The gaps have led to a long list of worthy candidates. Among those who did not make the cut this year are Bode Miller, Julia Mancuso, Dawn Staley and two-time Olympic gold-medal wrestler John Smith. Led by a record-setting 28 medals and 23 golds won by Phelps, this year's class has captured a total of 129 medals, including 86 gold. (With input from AP)
