At least 15 people have died in a dozen mudslides caused by heavy rains that have fallen since early May in Guatemala, where more than 500,000 people have been affected, officials said Monday. Among the 15 fatalities were a woman and her six children, as well as three brothers, all minors, from two indigenous villages, said the office of the Coordination for the Reduction of Natural Disasters.
