Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi is on a 10-day visit to eight countries in the South Pacific region. The trip came at a time of intense interest in the region, with the United States launching its Indo-Pacific Economic Framework during Biden's visit to Japan and Australia electing a new government. What are the expectations for the trip, and how will Pacific Island Countries deal with the engagement of China and other major countries? Guests in this edition of Dialogue are Professor Chen Hong from East China Normal University; David Mahon, Executive Chairman of Mahon China Investment Management; and Harvey Dzodin, Senior Fellow of the Center for China and Globalization.
