June 1 marks the International Children's Day. Caring about children, Chinese President Xi Jinping always encourages them to chase their dreams. In 2013, Xi visited a school in Lushan County of Ya'an City, southwest China's Sichuan Province, after a magnitude-7.0 earthquake struck the area on April 20. In a prefabricated classroom, he attended a class meeting with pupils and encouraged them to work hard in chasing their dreams. Nine years later, how are the children who once talked about their dreams with Xi? As the world celebrates the Children's Day, watch this video to see how Chinese children are growing up under Xi's care.
