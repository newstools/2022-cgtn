Inflation in the eurozone has hit another record high as the conflict in Ukraine has sent energy and food prices soaring. According to the EU's Eurostat data agency, inflation in the 19 countries that use the euro accelerated to 8.1 percent in May, up 0.7 percent from a month earlier. The eurozone's high inflation rate is putting pressure on the European Central Bank, which is set to raise interest rates in July and September.
