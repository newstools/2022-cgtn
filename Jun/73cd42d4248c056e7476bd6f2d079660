E1 co-founder Alejandro Agag announced a partnership with Oceans 2050, to help the all-electric racing series make contributions with a variety of action programs across the world's oceans. E1 is the first electric race boat championship sanctioned by the Union Internationale Motonautique (UIM) - the world governing body of power boating - and holds an exclusive license with the UIM to promote a racing series on the water powered solely by electric. The championship was established to create a new, competitive on-water racing proposition based on clean technologies to protect waters and coastal areas. Co-founder Rodi Basso spoke about the need for action and gave an example of how four-time Formula 1 world champion Sebastian Vettel helped to "spread the alarm" as he wore an underwater t-shirt at the Miami Grand Prix in May. "We have all seen in Formula 1, Sebastian Vettel wearing a shirt, you know spreading the alarm and awareness of how delicate a city like Miami, which is another incredible city, is facing, could be facing very big challenges for the survival of the city and their citizens. Of course, you know, given the trends and given how fast we have to look for solutions, that was very alarming but in the meantime, it definitely made a big point," said Basso on Vettel's Miami underwater t-shirt from the Miami Formula 1 Grand Prix in May and sustainability drive.
