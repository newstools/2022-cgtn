The International Day against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking, or World Drug Day, is held annually on June 26. The day is designed to strengthen action and cooperation in achieving a world free of drug abuse. This year, authorities in the eastern Chinese city of Ningbo destroyed more than 800 kilograms of illicit drugs as part of the World Drug Day efforts to help raise awareness of the major problem that illegal drugs pose to society. It was the largest drug haul destroyed in Ningbo in the past ten years. The drugs included cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, ketamine, marijuana, THC and ecstasy, among others.
