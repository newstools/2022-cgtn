Academy Award–winning actor Matthew McConaughey took to the podium in the White House briefing room on Tuesday to call on Congress to pass gun control legislation in honor of the children and teachers killed in last month's shooting rampage at an elementary school in his home town of Uvalde, Texas. In a highly personal 22-minute speech, McConaughey shared stories of the victims and offered a full-throated exhortation for a gridlocked Congress to pass gun reforms that can save lives without infringing on Second Amendment rights.
