The administration of U.S. President Joe Biden has made the final decision of excluding the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua from the 9th Summit of the Americas, which is to be held from June 6 to 10 in Los Angeles, Reuters reported on Sunday, citing sources familiar with the matter. The decision, which followed weeks of intense deliberations, poses the risk of an embarrassing boycott of the U.S.-hosted gathering if Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and some other leaders choose not to show up. The Mexican president had threatened to skip the summit unless all countries in the Western Hemisphere were invited. Cuban President Miguel Díaz-Canel said last month he would not go even if invited, accusing the U.S. of "brutal pressure" to make the summit non-inclusive. The White House did not respond to a request for comment, Reuters said. Commenting on the controversies over the summit's guest list, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on May 30 that Latin America is not a "front court" or "backyard" of a certain country. "I would like to stress that Latin America is by no means a 'front court' or 'backyard' of a certain country, and the Summit of the Americas is not a 'Summit of the United States of America,'" Zhao said at a regular press briefing. "The U.S. scheme to interfere in regional affairs by taking advantage of its capacity as the host of the Summit of the Americas is doomed to fail." Read more: A summit for America but not the Americas9th Summit of Americas: Invitation tensions, unambitious agenda
