China successfully launched three new remote sensing satellites into orbit with a Long March-2D carrier rocket on Thursday. The rocket blasted off from Xichang Satellite Launch Center in southwest China's Sichuan Province at 10:22 a.m. Beijing Time. The satellites then entered the pre-determined orbit, marking a complete success of the mission. The satellites, the second batch of the Yaogan-35 family, will mainly be used for scientific experiments, surveys of land resources, estimating agricultural production, as well as disaster prevention and mitigation. This mission is the 424th flight of the Long March series of carrier rockets. China launched the first batch of three Yaogan-35 satellites on November 6 last year.
