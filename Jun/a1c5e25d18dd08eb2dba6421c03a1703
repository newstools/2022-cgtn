An early goal from Pablo Sarabia earned Spain a 1-0 win in Switzerland on Thursday, their first victory of this year's Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) Nations League. Last year's finalists dominated the game from the start but were only able to score once, when Sarabia struck from close range in the 12th minute following a low cross by Marcos Llorente. After a mistake by the Swiss defense, the Atletico Madrid winger found Sarabia ghosting in between two opponents inside the six-yard box and he scored with a first-time shot. Spain have five points from their opening three Group A2 matches to sit two behind leaders Portugal and two ahead of third-placed Czech Republic. Switzerland have suffered three consecutive losses and are winless in their last five games since qualifying for this year's World Cup. Also on Thursday, Portugal scored twice in five minutes to beat the Czech Republic and open up a two-point lead at the top of Group A2 in the Nations League. Joao Cancelo and Goncalo Guedes were on target in the 33rd and 38th minutes in Lisbon as Portugal continued their strong start in the competition with a comfortable 2-0 win. Victory means they sit two points clear of Spain, having won two and drawn one of their opening three games. Cristiano Ronaldo almost added a third for Portugal but his first effort of the game was saved by Stanek. (With input from agencies)
