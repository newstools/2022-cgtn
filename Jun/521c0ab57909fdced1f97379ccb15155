Roberto Bautista Agut cruised past defending champion Daniil Medvedev 6-3, 6-2 to reach the semifinals of the Mallorca Championships on Thursday. Medvedev won his maiden grass title here last year, but the Spaniard stopped his title defense, as he took revenge on the World No. 1 who beat him on grass in straight sets at the Terra Wortmann Open in Halle last week. Second seed Stefanos Tsitsipas came through a grass-court battle against American Marcos Giron at the Mallorca Championships on Thursday to reach his first tour-level semifinal on the surface. The Greek prevailed in the first set tie-breaker, but lost his serve at the end of the second set as Giron forced the decider. Tsitsipas broke the American's serve at the end of the third set and closed out the match with an ace. In the semifinals, he will meet Benjamin Bonzi who earlier defeated Daniel Altmaier 6-3, 6-4.
