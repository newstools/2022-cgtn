The 1992 Consensus was the result of an agreement on the one-China principle by both sides of the Taiwan Straits, and there's no room for anyone to misinterpret it, Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, said on Thursday. Ma made the comment after Eric Chu Li-luan, leader of the Chinese Kuomintang party, said the consensus is a "non-consensus consensus" and an example of "creative ambiguity" during his visit to the United States. Taiwan is part of China, Ma said, adding that "cross-strait affairs should be managed within the family and not to be interfered by anyone outside the family." He said the 1992 Consensus was agreed upon on the basis of the one-China principle as well as the goal of unifying the country, which was put down in black and white. Based on the consensus, the Communist Party of China and the Kuomintang worked to advance the peaceful development of cross-Strait ties and promote peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Ma said. "Anyone who's dedicated to promoting cross-strait relations should be levelheaded when it comes to major issues such as overall national interests."
