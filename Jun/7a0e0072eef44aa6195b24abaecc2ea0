Cangzhou Mighty Lions opened the 2022 Chinese Super League season with an impressive 2-1 win over Beijing Guoan in Meizhou on Sunday. In the fourth minute, Beijing's Samuel Adegbenro threatened with a header as the Nigerian forward made his official debut. But for much of the first half, Guoan struggled to break down a stubborn Cangzhou defense. Crosses were often wasted and key chances were squandered. The staleness of play for both teams was on display for lengthy stretches amid the sweltering heat in south China's Guangdong Province, until promising young striker Bughrahan Skandar lacerated Beijing on a counter-attack shortly before halftime. The 21-year-old seized Oscar Maritu's brilliant pass and whacked a clever low shot into the net to make it 1-0 Mighty Lions in the 43rd minute. Guoan's chances of a comeback were greatly reduced after Zhang Chengdong felled Maritu and earned a red card just five minutes into the second half. The referee awarded Cangzhou a penalty kick in the 75th minute for a dangerous tackle by Adegbenro on Piao Shihao. Maritu tucked the ball into the corner of the net to double the lead to 2-0. Mighty Lions midfielder Guo Hao was sent off for a second yellow card in the 87th minute. But even though Yu Dabao's late strike gave Beijing a glimmer of hope in stoppage time, Cangzhou held on to claim the victory, 2-1. (With input from Xinhua)
