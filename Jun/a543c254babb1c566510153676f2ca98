Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Wednesday said that China is willing to work with other Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) member countries to carry forward the "Shanghai Spirit" and push to build a closer SCO community with a shared future. Wang made the remarks in an address to a roundtable virtual meeting of the eight-nation SCO, which is commemorating the 20th anniversary of its founding charter and the 15th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty on Long-Term Good-Neighborliness, Friendship and Cooperation by member states. He said the charter clearly defined the objectives and tasks of promoting regional peace and development, established important principles of mutual trust, mutual benefit and equal consultation, and marked the official entry of the organization into the international arena as a new progressive force. The document also injected positive energy into promoting the development of the international order in a more just and rational direction, he said. The SCO treaty stipulates mutual respect for the development path chosen by each other, reaffirms the principles of non-alignment, non-confrontation and non-direction at the third party, endows the "Shanghai Spirit" with new connotations, and has played a demonstration role for countries to live in harmony and pursue win-win cooperation, Wang said. Under the guidance of the Charter and the Treaty, the SCO, he said, has promoted the continuous upgrading of regional cooperation and made important contributions to building a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. "China is willing to work with SCO members to vigorously carry forward the 'Shanghai Spirit' and promote the building of a closer SCO community with a shared future," he said. Wang also called on SCO members to strengthen solidarity and coordination, jointly address risks and challenges, advance mutually beneficial cooperation, and improve global governance.
