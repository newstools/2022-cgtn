The British government said on Wednesday it was "disappointed" after the European Union launched legal action over a unilateral bid to overhaul Northern Ireland's post-Brexit trade deal. "We are disappointed that the EU has taken this legal action today," British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesperson told journalists, insisting that European proposals to resolve the impasse were a "step backwards".
