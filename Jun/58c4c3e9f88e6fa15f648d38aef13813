China stands ready to work with South Korea to properly handle sensitive issues to upgrade bilateral ties and move them steadily forward, Yang Jiechi, a senior Chinese diplomat, said on Thursday. Yang, a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and director of the Office of the Central Commission for Foreign Affairs, made the remarks during a phone conversation with Kim Sung-han, national security advisor of South Korea. Noting that China and South Korea are both close neighbors and important partners, Yang said China has worked together with all the South Korean administrations over the past 30 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations to leapfrog development in bilateral relations. The bilateral relations have seen a smooth start since Yoon Seok-youl was sworn in as president of South Korea in May, Yang said. Chinese Vice President Wang Qishan, Chinese President Xi Jinping's special representative, attended Yoon's inauguration ceremony. China is willing to work with South Korea to maintain close communication at all levels, deepen pragmatic cooperation and strengthen people-to-people exchanges, Yang said. He added, China is also ready to work with South Korea to safeguard genuine multilateralism and properly deal with sensitive issues to upgrade bilateral relations and move them steadily forward. For his part, Kim said the new South Korean administration attaches great importance to the development of relations with China and is willing to work with it to take the 30th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations as an opportunity to usher in a new era of South Korea-China cooperation.
