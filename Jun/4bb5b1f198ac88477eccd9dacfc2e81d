Bilateral cooperation between China and Papua New Guinea (PNG) has seen rapid progress in recent years, especially after the South Pacific island nation became the first in the region to sign an MOU in support of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) construction projects with China. Shortfalls in core infrastructure have "isolated" PNG and severely restricted its economic development in the past, but the completion of a number of China-PNG cooperation projects has positively altered the status quo. A CGTN stringer in PNG interviewed several local residents to learn about their impressions of China, and their views on bilateral cooperation.
