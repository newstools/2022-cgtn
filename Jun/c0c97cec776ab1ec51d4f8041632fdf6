China on Monday published a Global Development Report aimed at building a global community of development, according to the Center for International Knowledge on Development. The report analyzes the progress and challenges in implementing the UN 2030 Agenda, delineates the context of global development, explains the core concepts, fundamental principles, implementation pathways, and early harvests of the Global Development Initiative (GDI), and offers policy recommendations for building a global community of development, the center said in a statement. Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the GDI during an important speech at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the UN General Assembly on September 21, 2021. He called on the world to stay committed to development as a priority, stay committed to a people-centered approach, stay committed to benefits for all, stay committed to innovation-driven development, stay committed to harmony between man and nature and stay committed to results-oriented actions. The GDI focuses on practical cooperation in key areas, such as poverty reduction, food security, COVID-19 and vaccines, financing for development, climate change and green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity, to ensure that no country and no person is left behind. The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic posed serious challenges to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, resulting in the fall of the global average Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) index score for the first time in 2020 and threatening the realization of two-thirds of the 169 targets. It is likely that the pandemic may delay the realization of SDGs in the poorest countries and regions for a decade, the report said. Focusing on the severe challenges facing the world, especially in developing countries, the report seeks to renew focus on development issues, build international consensus and explore pathways for practical cooperation.
