European Central Bank (ECB) President Christine Lagarde said inflation in the eurozone will remain "undesirably high" for some time at an ECB forum on Tuesday. Lagarde said the ECB would go "as far as necessary" to hit its 2 percent inflation target "over the medium term," and she reaffirmed the bank's intention for an interest rate hike of 25 basis points in July.
