Singapore is known for its lush greenery, a 'city in a garden' and right in the heart of its central business district sits its first "Garden-in-a-Hotel." Parkroyal Collection Marina Bay boasts over 2,400 greens inside the hotel premises along with a variety of sustainable features spread across its operations. In conjunction with Singapore HeritageFest 2022, Parkroyal Collection took CGTN on a tour to showcase their sustainability efforts, which they believe will help them attract the fast-emerging environmentally-conscious traveller.
