A large bronze figurine was unearthed from No. 8 sacrificial pit of the Sanxingdui Ruins in southwest China's Sichuan Province. The figurine perfectly matches a bird foot statue unearthed 36 years ago from No. 2 sacrificial pit. When the two pieces are assembled, it can be divided into three parts, with the middle being a figure of a human head with protruding eyes and its feet in the shape of a bird's claw. The lower part is linked by the figure's hands and a square pedestal urn-shaped lei (an ancient wine vessel). The upper part of the head is a cinnabar trumpet-shaped  zun (an ancient wine vessel).
