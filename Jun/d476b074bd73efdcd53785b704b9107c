Coco Gauff will face world No.1 Iga Swiatek for the French Open title after the teenager eased into her maiden Grand Slam final with a straight-sets victory over Martina Trevisan on Thursday. The 18-year-old American claimed a 6-3, 6-1 win in a nervous match that saw both players featuring in a major semifinal for the first time. Gauff is the youngest Grand Slam finalist since Maria Sharapova won Wimbledon in 2004. "I think I'm a little bit in shock right now," Gauff said. "I didn't know how to react after the match. I'm lost for words." The 18th seed will be a heavy underdog against Swiatek, who is on a 34-match winning streak, in Saturday's showpiece match. Swiatek cruised into the final by beating Russian Daria Kasatkina 6-2, 6-1. Swiatek, who turned 21 on Tuesday, has climbed from world No. 7 to the top of the rankings on the back of a remarkable unbeaten run that has seen her win five successive tournaments, including four WTA 1,000 titles.
