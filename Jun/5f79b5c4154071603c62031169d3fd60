Eighteen-year-old American tennis player Coco Gauff spoke to the media on Saturday ahead of this year's Wimbledon. The French Open runner-up will open the tournament on Tuesday against Romania's Elena-Gabriela Ruse. During her press conference, Gauff took time to speak about her concern after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, which guaranteed a woman's constitutional right to abortion.
