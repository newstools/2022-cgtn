Australia's new cabinet was sworn in at a ceremony in Canberra on Wednesday. A day earlier, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese revealed the first ministry of his new Labor government, featuring record 13 women in the 30-member team. Linda Burney will become the first indigenous woman and second indigenous person to serve as the minister for Indigenous Australians. Ed Husic and Anne Aly will become the first Muslim ministers in Australian history, taking on the industry and science and early childhood education and youth portfolios, respectively. Deputy Prime Minister Richard Marles will be made defense minister and Clare O'Neil the minister for home affairs.Tanya Plibersek and Chris Bowen will be charged with delivering on Labor's climate policies as the respective ministers for environment and water, and climate change and energy. The announcement comes 10 days after Labor claimed victory in the general election, ending nearly nine years in opposition. On Tuesday, the Labor secured enough seats in the lower house of the parliament to form its own government without the support of independents or minor parties. Addressing a televised media conference on Tuesday evening, Albanese said that Labor had won 77 seats, a majority in the 151-seat House of Representatives.
