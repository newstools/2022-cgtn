Xie Feng, China's vice foreign minister, told China Media Group (CMG) in an exclusive interview that cooperation between China and Pacific Island Countries (PICs) is open and transparent. "The Pacific should be a stage of international cooperation, not an arena for geopolitical games," Xie said. Xie also stated that China is ready to work with PICs, upholding the principle of extensive consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits, to promote the region's development collectively.
