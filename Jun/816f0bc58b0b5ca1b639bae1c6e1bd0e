Underneath the hatred and gun violence lies a divided U.S. society, shattered by different personal beliefs over gun control, legal challenges and a political divide. Politicians, pro-gun interest groups, anti-gun social organizations, and both sides of the divide, all have their own ideology toward guns and refuse to compromise. So no matter how heated the debate is, nobody seems to be able to come forward with a quick fix. Opinion polls, government statistics and research by institutions are all pointing to an increasingly "Divided States of America".
