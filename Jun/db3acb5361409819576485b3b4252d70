Qatar is to host indirect talks between Tehran and Washington in a bid to revive the 2015 nuclear deal, an adviser to Iran's nuclear team told ISNA on Monday. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesman told reporters on Monday that Iran is committed to resolve the remaining issues "in the shortest time possible," and the discussions will focus on the removal of sanctions on Iran and non-atomic issues, which he said are already resolved.
