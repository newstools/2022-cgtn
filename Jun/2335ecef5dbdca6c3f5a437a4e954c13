NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg has been diagnosed with shingles and will therefore hold talks scheduled in Germany and Romania only remotely, a NATO official said on Thursday."The secretary-general will conduct his planned visit to Germany (and Romania) remotely rather than in person," the official told Reuters. "He has been diagnosed with shingles, which can occur after COVID-19, and is working from home."
