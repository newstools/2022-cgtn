Thai professional footballer Chaowat Veerachat trained with his new teammates for the first time and was introduced to supporters at halftime during Sunday's match at Yodoko Sakura Stadium in Osaka, a day after the 26-year-old officially confirmed his loan move to Cerezo Osaka. The Thai midfielder returns on loan to the club where he also spent time four years ago. "I'm very happy to be back to Cerezo Osaka," Veerachat said. The 26-year-old joined Cerezo Osaka's U-23 side in 2018, playing 14 times in the J3 League, before returning to star at BG Pathum United F.C., where he recently featured in the club's successful run through the AFC Champions League group stage. Earlier this month, Supachok Sarachat confirmed his move to Consadole Sapporo. Meanwhile, Thai superstar Chanathip Songkrasin is currently with J.League champions Kawasaki Frontale.
