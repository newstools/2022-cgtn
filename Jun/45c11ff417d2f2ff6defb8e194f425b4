Hong Kong is gearing up for celebrations to mark the 25th anniversary of its return to the motherland on July 1. Part of the festivities is the unveiling of the brand-new Hong Kong Palace Museum of Culture this weekend. Situated in the West Kowloon Cultural District, the museum will be Hong Kong's flagship art quarter and also one of the world's largest cultural centers. The opening exhibition will feature 900 carefully selected treasures from the Beijing Palace Museum. Richard Kimber brings us a sneak peek.
