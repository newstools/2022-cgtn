The Chinese Super League kicked off its 2022 season on Friday night with Shanghai Shenhua edging Guangzhou FC 1-0 in the Dalian zone. It was the first time in six years that Shenhua ran out winners against Guangzhou, formerly known as Evergrande. Zhu Chenjie scored a penalty early in the second half, and it proved to be the only goal of the match. Zhu made his name in China's World Cup qualifiers earlier this year, when Li Xiaopeng's side struggled with form and bowed out from the last 12 in the Asian Zone. Shanghai have built up a much stronger squad with several big names, including Zeng Cheng, Feng Xiaoting and Yu Hanchao. But coach Wu Jingui started without those veterans. Instead he let Chinese international Zhu Chenjie and Cameroon attacker Christian Bassogog lead the line-up for the opener. On the other side, Guangzhou featured an even younger team with an average age of just over 21 years old. The eight-time champions had to let go almost all of their stars at the end of last season due to lack of financial support from Evergrande Group, and the likes of Brazilian Paulinho had left the Super League. In the 53rd minute, a handball from Guangzhou defender Chen Rijin resulted in a penalty, which was duly converted by Zhu into the top corner. Despite a shuffle between Guangzhou captain Wei Shihao and Shanghai's Li Yunqiu, Shenhua managed to hold on to the 1-0 victory. The CSL continues its new season across three regions – Dalian, Meizhou and Haikou. Shenhua will next face city rivals Shanghai Port in the derby next Wednesday.
