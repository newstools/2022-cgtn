The art of the circus came relatively late to Brazil. But since the 1990s, one man has been on a quest to bring the joy of circus to all Brazilians. Marcos Frota created the UniCirco Institute in Rio de Janeiro to offer opportunities for socially vulnerable people. He recruited young students from the city's favelas and trained them to become professional performers, and some are already starring with the famous Cirque du Soleil! Caren Moy takes us to the vibrant world of Brazilian circus.
