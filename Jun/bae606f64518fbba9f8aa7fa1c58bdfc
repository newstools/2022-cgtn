The nationwide baby formula mess continues in the U.S. after newly released documents from the FDA admitted more deaths of children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) investigated reports that as many as nine children have died since early 2021 after consuming baby formula produced at an Abbott Nutrition plant in Michigan. Regulators reportedly did not inspect the Abbott Nutrition formula plant in Michigan for two years, and they didn't issue formal warning after finding environmental problems in the plant.
