China will step up efforts to support private investment and push ahead with multipurpose projects, according to arrangements made at a State Council executive meeting chaired by Premier Li Keqiang on Wednesday. The move aims to expand effective investment and boost consumption and employment, the meeting said. The country will also allow small, medium- and micro enterprises to defer payments of their basic medical insurance contributions, launch initiatives to end unjustified charges levied on businesses, and postpone payments for government administrative charges, it said.
