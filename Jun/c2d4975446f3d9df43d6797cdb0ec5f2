Inflation in the U.S. soared to 8.5% in March, the fastest 12-month rise since 1981. Annual inflation moderated in April, but the Consumer Price Index still increased at a rapid pace.

Can governments and central banks find effective tools to stabilize prices? To explore these questions and more, we've invited Jim Rogers, an international investor; Michele Geraci, former Under-Secretary of State of the Ministry of Economic Development of Italy; and Wang Dan, Chief Economist of Hang Seng Bank China.
