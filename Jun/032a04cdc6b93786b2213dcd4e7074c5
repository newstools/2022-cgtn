Real Madrid is signing another young, highly-rated French midfielder after reaching agreement with AS Monaco for the transfer of Aurelien Tchouameni on Saturday. The Spanish club issued a statement on Saturday, which read: "Real Madrid CF and AS Monaco have agreed on the transfer of the player Aurelien Tchouameni, who will be linked to the club for the next six seasons. "Next Tuesday, June 14, at 12:00 at Real Madrid City, the presentation ceremony for Aurelien Tchouameni as a new Real Madrid player will take place after the corresponding medical examination. "Aurelien Tchouameni will then appear before the media." Madrid did not disclose the fee for the 22-year-old France international, who has played with Monaco since January 2020 after joining from Bordeaux. Sections of the Spanish media reported the fee to be 100 million euros ($105 million) including variables. Madrid already has an even younger France midfielder in its squad in 19-year-old Eduardo Camavinga, who joined from Rennes last off-season, and played a key role - mostly off the bench - in the team's run to winning the UEFA Champions League title last month. Striker Karim Benzema is another France star in the Madrid team. (With input from AP)
