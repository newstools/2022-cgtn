Former Trump White House adviser Peter Navarro was arrested at a DC-area airport on Friday on contempt of Congress charges. Navarro, 72, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Thursday after snubbing a subpoena from the House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill riots, which was seeking testimony and documents.
