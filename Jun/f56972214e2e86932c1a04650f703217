The Biden administration will allocate 296,000 doses of vaccines to fight monkeypox from a national stockpile to states and territories in the coming weeks, the White House said on Tuesday, ramping up U.S. efforts to staunch the spread of the disease. Of the doses, 56,000 will be allocated immediately, and 1.6 million doses will be made available over the coming months, it said.
