Libya is considering to declare a state of force majeure within the next 72 hours unless production and shipping are resumed at the oil ports in the Gulf of Sirte, the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Monday in a statement on its official Facebook page. The Gulf of Sirte includes the export terminals of Es Sider, Ras Lanuf, Brega and Zueitina.
