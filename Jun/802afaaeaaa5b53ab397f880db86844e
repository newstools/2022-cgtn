Hong Kong has always had a unique charm. As a vital hub of cultural interaction between the East and the West, the distinctive charisma of its food, movies, and music has long been popular.

"Lion Rock" is a hip-hop ode to this spirit. Groove to the beats of this Cantonese-English rap track, tune in to the rhythm of Hong Kong's 25 years of development since its return to China and experience the city's warmth, unity and positivity with this retro Hong Kong-style video.
