Italy winger Lorenzo Insigne was welcomed to Major League Soccer's Toronto FC on Friday at the Cafe Diplomatico in the heart of Toronto's Little Italy. The 30-year-old Insigne, one of Italy's best players in their winning European Championship campaign last year, joins Toronto's roster as a designated player. Insigne, who has played 53 times for Italy and scored 10 goals, had been Napoli's captain since 2019. He joined the Serie A club as a 15-year-old player in 2006 and made his debut for the senior team in 2010. (With input from AP)
