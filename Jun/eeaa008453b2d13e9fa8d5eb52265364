The Lebanese presidency tweeted on Sunday that President Michel Aoun discussed with Prime Minister Najib Mikati the entry of a ship called Energean Power into the disputed maritime area with Israel. The presidency said, "negotiations to demarcate the southern maritime borders are still ongoing, and any action or activity in the disputed area constitutes a provocation and a hostile act."
