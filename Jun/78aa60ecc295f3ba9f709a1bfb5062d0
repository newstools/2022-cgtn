Polish President Andrzej Duda on Thursday welcomed the European Commission's (EC) approval of Poland's National Recovery Plan (KPO), but his country still has to wait for the fund. Speaking at a press conference with visiting EC President Ursula von der Leyen and Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki near Warsaw, Duda said the approvement "has a breakthrough significance for Poland to be able to obtain EU funds in the future," according to Polish Press Agency. A dispute over the rule of law had led to the EC delaying its approval of the KPO, prompting the Polish government to adhere to a European Court demand that it liquidate a judicial disciplinary body.
