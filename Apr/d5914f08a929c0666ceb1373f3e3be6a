With the Russia-Ukraine conflict ongoing, are we entering a dark age for arms control? The Russian Defense Ministry said on Thursday that its forces continued attacks on Ukraine's military facilities. NATO members have met to discuss supplying more weapons to Ukraine. These include heavy armaments that may be decisive in changing the course of the conflict. Since the conflict started in late February, Russia's political relationship with the West has been in free fall. The fraught atmosphere between Washington and Moscow also threatens existing nuclear arms treaties. On April 8, 2010, Russia and the United States signed The New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, also known as New START, which both sides agreed to extend for five years in 2021. The treaty is the last remaining nuclear arms control agreement between the two powers. With bilateral ties strained, are we going to see a second nuclear arms race? Is arms control even possible in the new world order?
