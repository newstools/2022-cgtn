A man died after ramming his car into the gates of the Russian embassy in Romania on Wednesday and setting himself on fire inside the vehicle, according to police. "So far, we can't say that this act is tied to something else other than the driver's personal circumstances," Romanian prosecutor Bogdan Staicu said.
