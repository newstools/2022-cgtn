Liaoning Flying Leopards defeated Zhejiang Lions to win their second Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) title in Nanchang, east China's Jiangxi Province, on Tuesday. Liaoning clinched four straight wins in the best-of-seven final series by romping to an easy 100-82 victory in Game 4. They led by 13 points after the first quarter and 29 after the second. That left their opponents with little chance, particularly with Zhejiang star guard Sun Minghui sitting on the bench in the third due to injury. Liaoning's Zhao Jiwei was named the Finals Most Valuable Player, bagging 57 points from the four matches. He contributed 20 points, 8 assists, and three steals in Tuesday's game.  The new champions replicated their pathway to victory from four years ago, defeating CBA powerhouses Guangdong Flying Tigers in the semifinal, and Zhejiang Lions in the final. Liaoning are the third CBA winners not to lose a single match in the playoffs. Their head coach Yang Ming was among the franchise players who helped the team clinch their maiden CBA title in 2018.  "I believe we are the best team in terms of performance and how we adjusted throughout this season," Yang said after the match. "Everyone strived to play better this year, committing to vigorous training and overcoming injuries. Congratulations to my team." (With input from Xinhua News Agency)
