The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Friday released its first report on reviewing Japan's policy to discharge treated water from the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station. IAEA said in the report that it will continue assessing Japan's compliance with safety requirements and will draw final conclusions at the end of the review process once "all relevant information has been considered and a holistic assessment can be performed."
