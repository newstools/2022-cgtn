Russia is reporting 27 missing crew members and one dead, after its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva, sank last week. It's the first time Moscow reported losses following the sinking, which it blamed on a storm as the ship was being towed to port. Ukraine however said it had damaged the ship with anti-cruise missiles. The Russian defense ministry said Ukrainian soldiers in the giant Azov-stal steel complex in Mariupol can still surrender and it is ready for a humanitarian ceasefire at Azov-stal if it sees "raising of white flags" from the hold-outs. Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Irina Vereshchuk said a humanitarian corridor may open in the besieged port city on Saturday. An attempt to evacuate civilians failed on Friday.
