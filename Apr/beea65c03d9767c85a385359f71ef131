Israeli police stormed the flashpoint Al-Aqsa mosque compound in East Jerusalem on Sunday, with at least 17 Palestinians injured during the ensuing clashes, according to local media reports. Israeli police entered the Temple Mount complex on Sunday morning, as hundreds of Palestinians allegedly sought to block Jewish visitors from visiting the holy site in Jerusalem's Old City, the Times of Israel said. Nine Palestinians were arrested during the unrest Sunday morning by Israeli forces. Sunday's incident comes two days after other clashes in the mosque which left over 150 injured. The Al-Aqsa Mosque compound is a flashpoint site holy to both Muslims and Jews. It is located in East Jerusalem, a territory captured by Israel along with the rest of the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. Israel annexed it shortly later in a move not recognized by most of the international community. (With input from Xinhua)
