Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Thursday warned that the U.S. side will bear all the consequences if it insists on going its own way over media reports on U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's planned visit to Taiwan. Wang made the remarks in a phone conversation with Emmanuel Bonne, diplomatic counselor to French President Emmanuel Macron, in which he condemned the United States' "blatant double stand" when it  openly tramples on the red line of the one-China principle while it urges respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity of a country on the Ukraine issue. "If Pelosi, a political leader of the United States, knowingly visits Taiwan, it would be a malicious provocation against China's sovereignty and gross interference in China's internal affairs, and would send an extremely dangerous political signal to the outside world," he said. On Thursday, the Chinese embassy in the U.S. also reiterated China's strong opposition to the issue and urged Washington to cancel it. Pelosi has tested positive for COVID-19 and her planned trip to Asia was consequently postponed.
