Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amirabdollahian said on Sunday that the way of diplomacy is open and the country continues this way in order to reach a good, sustainable and dignified agreement, according to the official news agency IRNA. Amirabdollahian also noted that Washington is "imposing new conditions" in the negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear agreement. "On the issue of lifting sanctions, they (the Americans) are interested in proposing and imposing new conditions outside the negotiations," IRNA quoted him as saying. Speaking about the necessity of holding direct talks with the U.S., Amirabdollahian added that Tehran has not received any interest from direct talks with Washington so far. "The Americans keep talking about the need for direct negotiations, but we have not seen the benefit of direct talks with the U.S.," he said. U.S. President Joe Biden should lift some sanctions on Iran to show his goodwill toward reviving the international nuclear agreement with Tehran, Amirabdollahian said. In July 2015, Iran signed the nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), with world powers, under which Iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for easing the U.S.-led sanctions. However, the U.S. government under former President Donald Trump unilaterally quit the pact in May 2018 and reimposed sanctions on Iran, prompting the latter to reduce its nuclear commitments in retaliation.
