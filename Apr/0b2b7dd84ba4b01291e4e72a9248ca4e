Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi says Italy does not expect its supplies of Russian gas to be cut off. When asked about a telephone call with President Putin on Wednesday, Draghi said Putin told him that current gas contracts remained in force. He also says he believes that Russia has reversed its demand for payment in rubles and that EU entities will continue to pay in euros and dollars.
