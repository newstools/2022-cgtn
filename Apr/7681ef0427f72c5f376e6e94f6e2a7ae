Xi Jinping was elected delegate to the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the CPC Guangxi regional congress by a unanimous vote on Friday. Xi was nominated by the CPC Central Committee as a candidate for delegate to the 20th CPC National Congress, scheduled to be held in the second half of 2022, and put to vote in the Guangxi electoral unit. During the CPC congress of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which was held on Thursday and Friday in the capital city of Nanning, the regional delegates said that Xi's election represents the shared aspiration of more than 2.5 million Party members and over 150,000 grass-roots Party organizations in the region. A total of 2,300 delegates to the 20th CPC National Congress will be elected by 38 electoral units across China, according to a statement issued by the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee in November 2021. The election will be completed by the end of June. The congress comes at an important time when the CPC has embarked on a new journey to build a modern socialist country in all respects and to realize the Second Centenary Goal, said the statement. The CPC typically convenes its national congress every five years. The 19th CPC National Congress was held in Beijing from October 18 to 24, 2017. (With input from Xinhua)
