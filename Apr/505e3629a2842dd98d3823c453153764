Saihanba National Forest Park, the largest park in northern China, is located in Weichang Manchu and Mongolian Autonomous County in Hebei Province.

Through decades of hard work by generations of tree planters, a forest belt of over 50 kilometers long from east to west and 17 kilometers wide from north to south was created on the beautiful highland.
