The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Wednesday expressed sympathy to those injured and their families following a subway shooting in New York City's Brooklyn, adding that no information about Chinese casualties had been received yet. China will continue to closely follow the progress of the incident, said the ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian. Zhao then said that such tragedies are part of America's chronic problems with gun violence. Coincidentally, the shooting came on the same day that the U.S. State Department released its "2021 Country Reports on Human Rights", which criticizes human rights situation in many other countries but makes zero mentions of its own deteriorating human rights situation. According to the latest data published on the Gun Violence Archive website, over 10,000 people in the U.S. have died from gun violence this year, including 131 mass shootings. Noting that the U.S. has become a veritable nation of guns now, Zhao said that "we hope such tragedies never happen again, and the people of the U.S. can live without gun shooting, discrimination and fear".
