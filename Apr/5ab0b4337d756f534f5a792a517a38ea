The world's first large dynamic positioning shallow-water exploration vessel, the "BGP (Bureau of Geophysical Prospecting INC.) Innovator," was successfully launched in Dalian City, northeast China's Liaoning Province, on April 22, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation.The "BGP Innovator" has adopted an all-electric propulsion system for the first time, realizing the digital management and intelligent control of the vessel's control system. It also has capabilities of integrated navigation, seismic source excitation, node repositioning, data collection and quality control.The vessel has realized the dual function of seismic source and node retraction. It is the only large shallow water dual function vessel in the world. The "BGP Innovator" has a shallow operating depth of five meters and can operate safely in depths of five to 40 meters. It can also realize satellite positioning operations. The "shallow-draft" design can meet the needs of a variety of operation regions and is suitable for exploration in different offshore areas around the world. This innovation fills the gap of similar offshore exploration equipment in the world. (Source: CCTV Plus)
