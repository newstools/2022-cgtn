Gaza militants fired another four rockets into Israeli territory in the early hours of Thursday, the Israeli military said. The army said it had intercepted the projectiles with an air defense system, hours after a previous rocket which prompted retaliatory Israeli strikes against the enclave controlled by Islamist group Hamas. A rocket landed in the southern Israeli town of Sderot on Wednesday night and was not intercepted by Israel's aerial defense system, according to Israeli police. Local media said a house was damaged by shrapnel. No group has claimed responsibility for the attack.
