The Forbidden City in Beijing has many different palaces which used to serve as the home of Chinese emperors and their households. And these different palaces have their typical plants, now it's time to show their beauty in spring to the public. Clusters of pear flowers decorate the Shoukang Palace, which was once the residence of widowed consorts. Duanhong Bridge, or Broken Rainbow Bridge has lilac bushes against it, the purple flowers lighten the stone lions on the bridge. The stone lions in the Imperial Garden have flowering plum as a company. The pink flowers have brought some romance feeling to the garden.
