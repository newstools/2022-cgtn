China launched a new Jilin-1 Gaofen 03D/04A remote-sensing satellite aboard a Long March-11 carrier rocket from East China Sea at 11:30 a.m. on Saturday. The Jilin-1 Gaofen satellite series, though has the word "Gaofen" in its name, is not a part of China's Gaofen satellite series. The word is an abbreviation for "high resolution" in the Chinese language. The new Earth-observation satellite has since successfully entered its predetermined orbit, which will provide commercial service for natural resource survey, urban planning, disaster monitoring and other businesses. The Jilin-1 constellation is expected to have 138 satellites by 2025 and become the largest commercial observation constellation in China. This is the 418th launch of the Long March rocket series.
