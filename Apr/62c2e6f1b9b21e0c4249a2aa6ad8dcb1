At least one person sustained injury due to a blast that rocked the Salim Karwan area of Police District 10 in Afghanistan's capital Kabul on Saturday, a statement from the interior ministry said. The explosive device was planted inside a vase alongside the road, the statement said. Kabul police spokesman Khalid Zadran also confirmed that one security personnel sustained an injury in the blast. This is the second blast in Kabul over the past four days. The previous one on Wednesday targeted a mosque and injured six people.
