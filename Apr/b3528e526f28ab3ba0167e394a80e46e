He said in the principle of non-interference in others' internal affairs and respect for Sri Lanka's willingness, China stands ready to play a constructive role in its economic and social stability and development. The Chinese premier also pledged that China will boost pragmatic cooperation with Sri Lanka in various fields, including negotiation and signing of a free trade agreement (FTA). Rajapaksa thanked China for providing emergency humanitarian aid, and appreciated the Chinese side's support for his country at a time of difficulties. Sri Lanka is ready to strengthen cooperation with China in finance, trade, tourism and others, and promote the negotiation process of the FTA.
