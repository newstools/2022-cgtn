Russia says it will launch an investigation into the footage reportedly coming from Bucha. The Kremlin has strongly denied responsibility for the killings and claims the footage was staged to frame Russian troops. Kyiv accused Moscow of killing over 300 civilians in Bucha. Moscow had requested for a UN Security Council meeting over the Bucha allegations and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says the Security Council will take this up on Tuesday. CGTN's Liu Jiaxin has more from Moscow.
