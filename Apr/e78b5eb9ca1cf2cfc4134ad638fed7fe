At least 50 worshipers were killed by an explosion at a mosque in the Afghan capital Kabul on Friday, Reuters has reported, citing the leader of the mosque. Local media puts the death toll even higher and some reports say over 200 were killed. Hundreds of worshipers were gathered for prayers on the last Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan when the explosion hit the mosque in the Darulaman area of west Kabul.
