Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban's ruling Fidesz-KDNP coalition has won Sunday's parliamentary elections, according to preliminary results from the National Election Office. Orban hailed his victory Sunday evening, saying it's a "huge victory." "Conservative politics has won, this is not the past, this is the Europe of the future," he told the cheering crowd at an entertainment shopping and cultural center in Budapest. Fidesz-KDNP led with 54.65 percent of the 71 percent of counted votes. The six-party opposition alliance came second with 33.55 percent and Mi Hazank (Our Homeland Movement) third with 6.41 percent. Fidesz-KDNP looks set to win 134 seats in the 199-seat parliament, gaining a two-thirds majority just like in 2018, 2014 and 2010. The official result will be issued later in the week, after the count of votes from Hungarians living and working abroad.
