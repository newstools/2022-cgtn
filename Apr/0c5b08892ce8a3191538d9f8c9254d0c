China on Friday expressed "strong disapproval of and firm opposition to" a joint press release following recent consultations between the United States and the European Union, and slammed their "double standards" on sovereignty and territorial integrity. "What the press release reveals is that there are indeed some countries and organizations in the world that are undermining the sovereignty and territorial integrity of other countries in the exact name of upholding sovereignty and territorial integrity," a spokesperson for the Chinese Mission to the EU said in a statement. "Such actions of double standard are nothing but blatant examples of bloc politics and ideological bullying," the spokesperson added.U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman met European External Action Service Secretary General Stefano Sannino in Brussels on Thursday and Friday. They raised concerns about China regarding the Ukraine situation and commented on a range of China-related issues such as Taiwan, Xinjiang, human rights and "economic coercion," according to the press release. "Holding consultations between the U.S. and the EU is their own business," the spokesperson said. "However, we firmly oppose them making an issue out of China, and using consultations as an excuse to threaten and pressure China. The joint press release grossly interfered in China's internal affairs and made groundless smears and attacks on China." The parties concerned should not underestimate China's firm resolve to defend its sovereignty and the strong will of the Chinese people to safeguard their national dignity, the spokesperson said. The spokesperson urged the EU and the U.S. to abandon their Cold War mentality, refrain from "pulling small circles that pit against one another," and stop provoking confrontation.
