The Sri Lankan police shot dead one man and wounded 10 others Tuesday, officials said, in the first killing of a protester in weeks of anti-government demonstrations over the island's crisis. Police used live ammunition against a group who were blocking a highway in Rambukkana to protest acute oil shortages and high prices, hospital and police officials said.
