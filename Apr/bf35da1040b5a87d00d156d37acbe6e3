On March 12, CGTN correspondent Dmitriy Maslak was reached by a local woman while reporting in Volnovakha, Ukraine. She asked Maslak to help find her daughter, who'd left the city. The city's communications with the outside world was broken. As communication in the city has been partially restored, Maslak offered the woman access to his cell phone to contact her daughter.
