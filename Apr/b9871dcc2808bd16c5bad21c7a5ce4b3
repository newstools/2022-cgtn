British Prime Minister Boris Johnson officially announced his "Living with COVID" plan on February 21, 2022. On April 1, restrictions and free mass testing in England ended, which meant those who tested positive for COVID-19 were no longer legally required to isolate. According to data released by the Office for National Statistics on April 14, the week ended April 9 saw approximately 4.4 million new COVID-19 infections, equal to one in every 15 people in the UK. In an interview with China Media Group (CMG), Ben Chacko, chief editor of the Morning Star, said, "The government placed all responsibility for containing the virus onto individuals."
