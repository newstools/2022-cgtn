Charles Leclerc steered his Ferrari race car to lead in the 58-lap race and win the F1 Australian Grand Prix (GP) at the Albert Park in Melbourne on April 10. "In F1, it's the first race where we controlled a little bit the gap," said Leclerc, who took the chequered flag by a massive 20.5 seconds. "Honestly, what a car today. Of course, I did [well] all weekend, but it was not possible without the car. And this weekend, especially in the race pace, we were extremely strong. Tires felt great from the first lap to the last lap, we were managing the tires extremely well, and I am just so happy."
