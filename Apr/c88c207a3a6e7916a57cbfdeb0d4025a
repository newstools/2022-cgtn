Paris Saint-Germain secured a record-equaling 10th Ligue 1 title on Saturday after being held to a 1-1 home draw by 10-man Lens. It was Lionel Messi who finally gave the match a moment to remember, bending a trademark finish home from the edge of the box in the 68th minute, but Lens dampened the already muted title party at the Parc des Princes through Corentin Jean with two minutes left. PSG have an unassailable 16-point lead over second-placed Marseille with four matches remaining. Argentinian Messi has scored four Ligue 1 goals in a disappointing first season for PSG since leaving Barcelona. Mauricio Pochettino's men reclaimed the crown from Lille, who were shock champions last season. It is the capital giants' eighth Ligue 1 triumph in the last 10 seasons, powered by the investment of their Qatari owners. In the Bundesliga, Bayern Munich eased past title rivals Borussia Dortmund 3-1 on Saturday to secure their 10th consecutive league crown in front of a sold-out home crowd and with three games to spare. First-half goals from Serge Gnabry and Robert Lewandowski put the hosts 2-0 up before Emre Can cut the deficit with a 52nd-minute penalty. Jamal Musiala got Bayern's third goal seven minutes from the end. Bayern, 12 points clear of second-placed Dortmund, have now won 31 Bundesliga titles since the introduction of the top division in 1963, and 32 German league crowns in all, while Thomas Muller became the first player to win 11 league titles. "Just for these moments ... this is the best," Muller said. "We really wanted to win it here. There was a lot of frustration in the past days and we could play it off today."
