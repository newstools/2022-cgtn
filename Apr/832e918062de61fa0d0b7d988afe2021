The 52-year-old Dutch coach would leave Dutch side Ajax and replace Manchester United's interim manager Ralf Rangnick from Germany. "Manchester United is delighted to announce the appointment of Erik ten Hag as men's first team manager, subject to work visa requirements, from the end of this season until June 2025, with the option to extend for a further year," United said in a statement. "In our conversations with Erik leading up to this appointment, we were deeply impressed with his long-term vision for returning Manchester United to the level we want to be competing at, and his drive and determination to achieve that," read the statement on the club's official website. "We wish Erik the best of luck as he focuses on achieving a successful end to the season at Ajax and look forward to welcoming him to Manchester United this summer." In response, the newly appointed manager said, "It is a great honor to be appointed manager of Manchester United and I am hugely excited by the challenge ahead. I know the history of this great club and the passion of the fans, and I am absolutely determined to develop a team capable of delivering the success they deserve."
