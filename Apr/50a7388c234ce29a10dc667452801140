The Premier League "title decider" between Liverpool and Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday night was finished 2-2. City are still one point ahead of Liverpool, and both have seven more games to play. Liverpool's schedule seems harder because they will play against Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur, but City tripped over weak opponents before. Actually, one of the reasons Liverpool managed to catch up was that City made too many mistakes. The two teams will meet again in the FA Cup semifinal and have the chance to play against each other in the UEFA Champions League. Neither Liverpool nor City can afford to make more mistakes because there is already too much at stake.
