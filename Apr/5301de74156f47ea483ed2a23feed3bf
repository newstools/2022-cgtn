China has lodged stern representations with the United States after Washington approved a potential sale to the Taiwan region of equipment, training and other items valued at up to $95 million, the Chinese Ministry of National Defense spokesperson Tan Kefei said Thursday. The arms sale from the U.S. to Taiwan grossly interfered with China's internal affairs, severely damaged China's sovereignty and security interests, and undermined the China-U.S. military relations and the peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, Tan said.
