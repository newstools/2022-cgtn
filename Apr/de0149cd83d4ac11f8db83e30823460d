The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has conducted a new type of tactical guided weapon test that was observed by top leader Kim Jong Un, the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Sunday. The "new-type tactical guided weapon... is of great significance in drastically improving the firepower of the frontline long-range artillery units and enhancing the efficiency in the operation of tactical nukes," the KCNA reported, without specifying when the test took place. It said the test was successful. Kim gave a military research team "important instructions on further building up the defense capabilities and nuclear combat forces," the report added. Photos carried by the Rodong Sinmun newspaper showed a grinning Kim, surrounded by uniformed officials, applauding as he watched what it said was the test-firing of the weapon. The military of the Republic of Korea said on Sunday that the DPRK fired two projectiles off its east coast towards the sea on Saturday. On Friday, the DPRK celebrated the 110th anniversary of the birth of late founder Kim Il Sung by holding a large-scale civilian rally and parade in central Pyongyang. (With input from AFP, Reuters)
