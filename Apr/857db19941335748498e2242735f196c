In late March, we reported on a special art class in a bomb shelter in the western Ukrainian city of Lviv. Chinese student Ke Yi started an art class in the city to help children recreate happy memories. A month later, the shelter has received nearly 200,000 yuan in donations from China. With the money, Ke bought basic necessities for the shelter, such as mattresses and sheets, and a secondhand van to help transport women and children to safer countries and regions.
