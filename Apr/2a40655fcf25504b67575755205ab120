The hull of a missing Japanese tourist boat was found on the seabed Friday morning by the country's coast guard, according to NHK. The tourist boat, Kazu One, was carrying 26 people when it went missing off the Shiretoko Peninsula in Japan's northernmost prefecture of Hokkaido on April 23 after making a distress call saying it was taking on water in rough seas. Fourteen bodies have been retrieved so far.
