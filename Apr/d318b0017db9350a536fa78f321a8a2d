"Trying to replace Russia with another country (in the G20) is not going to work," Petr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, said in an interview with CGTN on April 18. He thought that the attempt to remove Russia from the G20 was an effort on the part of the West to discredit Russia. U.S. President Joe Biden said Russia should be removed from the G20 during a press conference on March 24 after he met with EU and NATO leaders in Brussels. He also said Ukraine should be allowed to attend the summit if Indonesia, which holds the rotating presidency of the G20, doesn't agree to remove Russia from the group.
