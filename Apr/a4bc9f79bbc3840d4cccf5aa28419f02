A comprehensive dialogue among Sudanese political forces is scheduled to be held May 10-12, African Union (AU) special envoy to Sudan, Mohamed El Hacen Ould Lebatt, said on Wednesday. The dialogue was brokered by a tripartite mechanism of the United Nations, the AU and the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development, an eight-country trade bloc in Eastern Africa. The mechanism seeks to raise awareness among Sudan's political forces regarding a fair and transparent national dialogue and agreeing on a political process to bring all actors back to a democratic constitutional situation for a transitional period, according to the envoy. Volker Perthes, head of the UN Integrated Transitional Assistance Mission in Sudan, cautioned that unless the current political crisis in Sudan is solved, the country risks becoming even more unstable. Sudan has been suffering a political crisis after the general commander of the Sudanese Armed Forces Abdel Fattah Al-Burhan declared a state of emergency on October 25 last year and dissolved the Sovereign Council and the government. Since then, protests in Khartoum, Sudan's capital, and other cities have persisted to demand a return to civilian rule.
