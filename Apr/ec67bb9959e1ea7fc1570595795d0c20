China has been replaced by Japan as hosts of the East Asian Football Championships in July due to COVID-19 issues, organizers said on Tuesday. China had been due to host the East Asian Football Federation's (EAFF) flagship competition for the third time after 2008 and 2015 but withdrew due to the "recent situations of COVID-19 pandemic" across China. Japan will now host the event, which features tournaments for both men's and women's teams, from July 19 to 27, with Chinese men's U23 and women's sides to take part in the competition. South Korea and Japan will be joined by China and China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the men's tournament after the EAFF scrapped plans for a qualifying tournament involving other regional sides. The women's competition will feature recently crowned Asian Cup winners China as well as Japan, South Korea and Chinese Taipei. Currently, Chinese football teams are suffering heavy blows in the group stage of the AFC Champions League, as Guangzhou FC and Shandong Taishan FC have sent their second-string lineups to Malaysia and Thailand, respectively, as the clubs are preparing for the domestic Chinese Super League, which has yet to announce an opening date.
