U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi should cancel her trip to the Taiwan region rather than postpone it, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Friday Zhao made the remarks when asked to comment on Pelosi's decision to postpone her trip to Asia following a positive COVID-19 test. China considers Taiwan part of its territory. Zhao extended sympathy over the U.S. speaker's infection and wished her a speedy recovery.
