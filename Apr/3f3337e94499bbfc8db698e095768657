Ecuadorian President Guillermo Lasso on Friday declared a 60-day state of emergency, including curfews in some areas and the deployment of thousands of security forces, in three provinces of his country, citing a rise in crime. "Through an executive decree I have declared a state of emergency in the provinces of Guayas, Manabi and Esmeraldas effective from midnight tonight," Lasso announced on his social media. Some 9,000 police and military will patrol streets in the three provinces during the 60 days, while certain neighborhoods will have curfews from 11 p.m. until 5 a.m. (0400-1000 GMT). ”Our peace will never be sacrificed to criminal gangs,” he said.
