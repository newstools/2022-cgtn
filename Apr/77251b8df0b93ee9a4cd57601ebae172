Despite the relatively low fatality rate of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus, its high transmissibility means that large-scale infections will still result in a lot of deaths, China's top respiratory expert Zhong Nanshan said on Friday. "Therefore, at present, opening up entirely does not apply to China. The country should stick to its 'dynamic zero-COVID' strategy and loose restrictions gradually," he was quoted as saying at a webinar organized by Tianjin's Nankai University. Due to the mild symptoms and relatively low mortality rate of Omicron, some countries have chosen to live with the virus, Zhong said, adding it's not an option for China, based on the evaluation of the latest COVID-19 outbreaks in Hong Kong and Shanghai. Hong Kong reported over 1.1 million COVID-19 cases and more than 8,000 deaths in its latest Omicron wave, with a mortality rate of 0.7 percent, which is way higher than the death rate of common flu (0.006 percent to 0.09 percent), Wang Guqiang, head of the Infectious Disease Department at No. 1 Hospital of Peking University, said at press briefing on Wednesday. Zhong pointed out the key issue of combating COVID-19 is to minimize the virus transmission and the fatality rate. He also recommended "sequential vaccinations" for people to boost immunization against the virus, which means using a different kind of vaccine as a booster shot.
