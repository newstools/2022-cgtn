The Chinese men's freestyle wrestling team is preparing for its upcoming competitions in a training camp in southern Hainan Province. The camp in Baisha is being led by a new coaching team, with both Chinese and foreign instructors. And wrestlers from Cuba and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have also been invited to the camp for exchange of skills and strategies. Experts in physical rehabilitation, psychological counseling and nutrition are available to help the Chinese wrestlers with post-training recovery. Among the Chinese wrestlers at the camp are 34-year-old Deng Zhiwei, who placed fifth at the 2019 world championships. And the two-time Olympian missed out on a bronze medal in the 125 kg division at last year's Tokyo Olympics. Also in the camp are such young talents like Liu Minghu from southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
