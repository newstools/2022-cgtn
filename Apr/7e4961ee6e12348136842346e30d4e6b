The Sri Lankan government declared a 36-hour nationwide curfew on Saturday under a state of emergency to quell protests against worsening shortages of fuel, food and medicines. The lockdown will go into effect at 6 p.m. Saturday and be lifted on 6 a.m. Monday. Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa invoked a state of emergency on Friday following a violent attempt to storm his house, saying it was for the "protection of public order." Rajapaksa said the emergency was declared in the interest of public security, protection of public order and the maintenance of supplies and services essential to the life of the community. The island nation of 22 million people is struggling with rolling blackouts for up to 13 hours a day due to shortage of foreign exchange to import fuel.
