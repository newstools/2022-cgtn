Spanish teenager Carlos Alcaraz captured the fourth title of his young career by beating eighth seed Pablo Carreno Busta 6-3, 6-2 in the Barcelona Open final on Sunday, hours after winning a grueling semifinal that was postponed due to rain. Starting from Monday, the 18-year-old player stands at No. 9 in the world ranking. The U.S. Open quarter-finalist joins countrymen including Nadal, coach Juan Carlos Ferrero and Carlos Moya in lifting the trophy in the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) clay-court tournament. "It means a lot. I've watched this tournament since I was a kid. I always wished to play in this tournament and of course be able to win this tournament," Alcaraz said. "I'm really happy to be part of the (historic) Spanish list." His singles tally stands at four titles following triumphs at Barcelona, Miami and Rio de Janeiro this year, and a victory at Croatia Open last July, when he became the youngest tour-level champion since Kei Nishikori of Japan claimed the title at Delray Beach in 2008. The next-generation ATP Finals champion had to work hard for his latest crown, with the semifinals at Barcelona pushed to Sunday because of rain on Saturday and Alcaraz saved two match points to overcome Alex de Minaur 6-7(4), 7-6(4), 6-4. His victory in three hours and 40 minutes earned him a title clash with mentor Carreno Busta. "It's tough to play a final this afternoon after this match, after this week, but it's a final," Alcaraz said earlier. "You have to give 100 percent, fight until the last ball. It's no time to be tired, you have to fight like the first day."
