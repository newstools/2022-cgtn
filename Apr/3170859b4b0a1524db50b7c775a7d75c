China National Botanical Garden held an inauguration ceremony in Beijing on Monday. The garden, situated in Beijing, the Chinese capital, with an area of about 600 hectares, will help strengthen the ex-situ conservation of endangered plant species. China is one of the countries with the highest plant diversity. According to the National Forestry and Grassland Administration, the national botanical garden system is expected to help the country gradually bring all of its key protected plant types under ex-situ conservation. The garden plans to collect more than 30,000 kinds of plants, including representative plants in the north temperate zone and different geographical regions of the world as well as rare and endangered plants. It also plans to collect 5 million representative plant specimens from five continents. Plus, it will establish cooperative relationships with botanical gardens and institutions in hundreds of countries.
