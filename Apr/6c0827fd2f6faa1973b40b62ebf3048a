China's Greco-Roman wrestling team has been training for the Asian Games, focusing on improving the physical fitness of team members during their build-up in southern Hainan Province.The squad started training on February 5, and has been working to increase their strength and abilities. Greco-Roman wrestling places an emphasis on taking the initiative to attack. So China's coaches are reinforcing the idea of active attacks, and stressing the importance of seizing every opportunity during competitions. Strengthening their physical fitness is the main task. Team coach Sheng Jiang said, "In Greco-Roman wrestling, nothing is more important or crucial than physical fitness. So through fitness testing, we found out our deficiencies, and we try to make up for those, even in our spare time, as we make specific training plans for specific wrestlers. Our training not only includes physical improvements, but also analyzing our opponents' performances, as we gear up for the Asian Games and the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics."
