Three taikonauts, one space station, seven days and 64 kilometers: a hearing-impaired man delivered his special welcome home to the returning heroes. The 33 year-old man is from Chifeng City in northern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He used a Global Positioning System (GPS) to 'draw' taikonauts Zhai Zhigang, Ye Guangfu and Wang Yaping by 'tracing' their portraits with his route.
