Moscow claims it has information that an array of biological laboratories engaged in developing bioweapons have been found, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Saturday. "Within the framework of a program funded by the Pentagon, a whole network of biolabs have been created around Russia and Belarus, which not only deal with extremely dangerous pathogens, microbes, viruses, but also work on projects to invent new types of biological weapons," Peskov said in an interview with Belarus-24 TV channel. "The Americans are now trying to divert attention from the issue of biological laboratories, but facts speak for themselves. The issue concerns Russia and many other countries," he said. The "dangerous biological activities of the United States" were discovered during Russia's "special military operation" in Ukraine, Irina Yarovaya, deputy chairperson of the State Duma, or the lower house of Russia's parliament, said earlier this week. Both Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and U.S. President Joe Biden have denied similar claims during public events and on Facebook. They also claim that Moscow intends to use biological and chemical weapons against Ukraine. There is little evidence to support either side's claim. In the meantime, Russian lawmakers have formed a commission to investigate U.S.-controlled biological laboratories in Ukraine. (With input from Xinhua)
