Nantong City will send five batches of vegetable supplies to its close neighbor Shanghai to support the epidemic-hit metropolis in its fight against COVID-19. The first batch of vegetables, weighing over 1,500 tons, arrived in the Pudong New Area of Shanghai on April 14. A team of more than 300 volunteers worked day and night to sort, pack and load the 250,000 packages. Nantong Agricultural and Sideline Products Logistics Center cooperated with governments at all levels in the province to secure sources of the produce. Each package, with six kinds of fresh vegetables, can meet the basic living needs of a family for about three days.
