Slovakia is willing to pay for Russian gas in rubles to keep its gas supply, the country's Economy Minister Richard Sulik said on national television on Sunday. "If there is a condition to pay in rubles, then we will pay in rubles," Sulik said, adding that the EU member state relies on Russian gas for around 85 percent of its demand, RT reported on Sunday. "We cannot be cut off from gas," Sulik emphasized. The minister added that Slovakia would continue to work on a common approach with the EU, Reuters reported on Sunday. Slovak state gas company SPP paid its March invoice for gas in euros, as stipulated in its contract, Reuters reported. Sulik said the country still had six weeks to find a solution before the next gas payment is due on May 20, but Slovakia could not go without deliveries, according to Reuters. Last week Russia demanded all "unfriendly" countries, including EU members, pay for gas in rubles. The decision was made to secure Russia's ability to trade and to ensure that its producers receive their money despite Ukraine-related Western sanctions, Dmitry Peskov, press secretary to Russian President Vladimir Putin, said on Friday, according to RT.
