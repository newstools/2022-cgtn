The town of Borodoyanka in the Kyiv region is back under the Ukrainian government's control after weeks of Russian occupation. CGTN visited the town along with other journalists invited by Ukraine's Ministry of Defense. For nearly a month, Borodyanka was bombed and occupied by Russian soldiers. Residents say hundreds of military vehicles passed by in the first days, with more Russian soldiers on the streets than local people. Ukraine says about 200 people are missing. Meanwhile, the military has been clearing mines left behind by Russian troops.
