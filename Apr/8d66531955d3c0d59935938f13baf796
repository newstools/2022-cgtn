China and Iran agreed on Wednesday to further develop all-round cooperation, including in the military field. The agreement was reached during a meeting between Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi and the visiting Chinese State Councilor and Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe in Tehran. Raisi said that Iran opposes unilateralism, hegemonism and external interference and firmly supports China in safeguarding its core interests. He also thanked China for its support and assistance over the years in a difficult period. General Wei said that China and Iran are ancient civilizations whose traditional friendship has gotten even stronger over time. His visit, he said, is important against the backdrop of the current turbulent international situation and shows the importance of China-Iran relations, embodying mutual firm support and common progress. Military-to-military cooperation between China and Iran has been expanding in recent years, and the Chinese military is willing to cooperate with the Iranian side to push it to a higher level, he said. Chief of Staff of Iran's Armed Forces Mohammad Bagheri also met on Wednesday with Wei, who also held talks with Iranian Defense Minister Gharaei Ashtiani. During these discussions, the two sides exchanged views on the international and regional security situation, the Iranian nuclear issue and the situation in Ukraine. They also reached a consensus on strengthening strategic communication at the top level of the two militaries and deepening practical cooperation in such areas as exchanges involving services and arms, joint exercises and training.
