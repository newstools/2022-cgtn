Russia's lunar program will be resumed, President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday, adding that he was referring to the Luna-25 mission. Putin made the remarks as he spoke to staff at the Vostochny Cosmodrome in Russia's far eastern region of Amur, during a trip with his Belarusian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko. Putin said Russia and Belarus would jointly form infrastructure in the space sector, and asked Russian astronauts to provide training and a flight into space for a representative from Belarus. April 12 is the International Day of Human Space Flight, which marks the date of the first human space flight, carried out by Yuri Gagarin, a Soviet citizen. Talking about the "special military operation" in Ukraine, Putin said there was no doubt that the goals and objectives of the operation would be fulfilled.
