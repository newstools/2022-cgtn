Fresh clashes erupted between Palestinians and Israeli forces at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque compound early Friday, local media reported. The Times of Israel said 27 people were injured, including two seriously, citing the Red Crescent. The holy site in Jerusalem's Old City has seen clashes almost daily over the past week. Israeli police said hundreds of people began rioting during early morning Muslim prayers on Friday, hurling rocks and fireworks at officers. The clashes later intensified. "Police forces were forced to use riot dispersal means and to push the mob back," according to an Israeli police statement quoted by the newspaper. The disputed holy site, known to Muslims as the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and to Jews as the Temple Mount, is located in the Old City of Jerusalem. The site has been administered by Jordan's Muslim Waqf but secured by Israeli police. Over the past few weeks, at least 200 Palestinians have been injured at the compound during clashes with Israeli forces. (With input from Xinhua)
