The lower house of Pakistan's parliament, the National Assembly, on Monday delayed a session to decide the new prime minister of the country after the ousting of Imran Khan who lost a no-confidence vote on April 10. The session was previously scheduled to convene at around 2 p.m. (0900 GMT). Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) said all PTI members will resign from the National Assembly in protest after a new prime minister is elected.
