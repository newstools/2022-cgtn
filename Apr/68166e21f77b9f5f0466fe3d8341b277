On April 10, 2022, a Yangtze finless porpoise was spotted swimming in the warm water of the Yangtze River in Yichang City, central China's Hubei Province. The Yangtze finless porpoise is a critically endangered species, under first-class state protection in China. Due to the fishing ban in the Yangtze River area, the population is expected to gradually recover.
