British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said on Sunday that Luke Symons, who was "unlawfully" detained without charge or trial since 2017 in Yemen by the Houthis, has been released and will shortly be reunited with his family. Luke Symons was accused by the Houthis of "spying for the British government" and arrested at a security checkpoint in the southwestern city of Taiz on April 4, 2017.
