China has expressed its firm opposition to the U.S. approval of an arms deal with Taiwan worth $95 million and pledged to take firm and forceful measures to resolutely safeguard its sovereignty and security interests. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Wednesday that the arms sale severely encroaches on China's sovereignty, security and development interests, damages China-U.S. relations and endangers peace and stability across the Taiwan Straits. He urged the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques and cease arms sales and military interactions with Taiwan. Ma Xiaoguang, spokesperson for the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, on Wednesday urged the U.S. to immediately rectify its wrong move and stop playing with fire on issues concerning Taiwan. Ma also slammed Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party authority for colluding with external forces to seek "independence" and political self-interests. (Cover: File photo of Taipei in Taiwan, China. /CFP)
