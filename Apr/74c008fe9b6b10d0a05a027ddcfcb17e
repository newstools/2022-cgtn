Like other felines, leopard cats are nimble night hunters in the forest of Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province. People rarely catch sight of them in the daytime because most of them are active at night or before dawn. The leopard cat gets its name because the spots or rosettes on its body are similar to those on a leopard. It is about the size of a domestic cat, but more slender, with longer legs, and much more competitive in the wild. Rodents, lizards, amphibians, birds and insects are all on its menu. Even the giant panda mother has to keep away from the adult leopard cat to protect its cubs. Except during the breeding season, leopard cats are solitary. They are agile climbers and love to rest in trees. They are now under second-class state protection in China.
