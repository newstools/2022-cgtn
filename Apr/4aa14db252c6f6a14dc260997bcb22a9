Chinese Foreign Ministry has censured some European and American media for making different remarks to refugees from Syria and Ukraine, highlighting Western media's double standards on the refugee issue. It is a typical example of racial discrimination and double standards to classify races and show sympathy selectively by self-set standards, spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a regular press conference in Beijing on Thursday. It has exposed the deep-rooted white supremacy and superiority of civilization of some countries, he added. People can be identified by language and skin color but it does not establish one's superiority over the other, Zhao stressed. A country claiming to be "a model of human rights" should abandon its arrogance and prejudice and stop undermining the peace and tranquility of other countries, he said. The racist remarks by Western media have aroused strong dissatisfaction in relevant countries and regions. The spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has called for remembering that all refugees are humans, be it from Syria, Afghanistan or Ukraine, Zhao quoted. World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has also pointed out on Wednesday that the ongoing crises in countries like Ethiopia, Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria have received little global attention compared to the crisis in Ukraine.
