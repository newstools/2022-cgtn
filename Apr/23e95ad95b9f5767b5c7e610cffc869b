China is ready to synergize its development strategies with Azerbaijan, deepen practical cooperation in various fields, consolidate the traditional friendship between the two peoples and cement the social foundation of bilateral relations, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Wednesday. He made the remarks during a phone conversation with his Azerbaijani counterpart Jeyhun Bayramov on the 30th anniversary of diplomatic ties. This year marks the 30th anniversary of China-Azerbaijan diplomatic relations, Wang noted. He said the two nations had stood together through thick and thin over the past 30 years and had jointly burnished the golden banner of a friendly and cooperative partnership. China will, as always, respect Azerbaijan's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, and support the Azerbaijani people in choosing their own development path in light of their own national conditions, he said. The foreign minister said he believes the Azerbaijani side will continue to support China's legitimate position on issues involving China's core interests, always follow the one-China policy, and oppose any form of "Taiwan independence." Bayramov, for his part, congratulated China on the successful hosting of the Winter Olympics and thanked China for its valuable assistance in Azerbaijan's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, noting that China's vaccine assistance has made Azerbaijan one of the first countries in the world to have COVID-19 vaccines. The two sides should celebrate the 30th anniversary of their diplomatic relations in a grand manner and strengthen bilateral and multilateral cooperation, said Bayramov, adding that Azerbaijan will continue to abide by the one-China principle.
