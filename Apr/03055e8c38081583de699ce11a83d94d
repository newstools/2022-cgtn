The Russian Defense Ministry said on Friday it was ready for a humanitarian cease-fire at Mariupol's Azovstal steel plant - the last stronghold of Ukrainian forces in the strategic port city - if Kyiv's soldiers surrender. The defense ministry added that the cease-fire would start with the "raising of white flags" by Ukraine's forces.
