Sri Lanka's Central Bank Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said in a tweet that he had submitted his resignation to the president amid the country's economic crisis. The country's Colombo Stock Exchange on Monday said it had halted trading of shares for 30 minutes due to a sharp fall in the benchmark share price index. "Please note that the market has been halted for 30 minutes due to the S&P SL20 index dropping over 5 percent from the previous close," the bourse said on its website. "The halt will be lifted at 11:02 a.m."
