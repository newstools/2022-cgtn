After the Russia-Ukraine talks in Istanbul on March 29, Russia's armed forces scaled back their military operations near Kyiv. On April 2, Ukraine's defense ministry says its forces have seized control of the Kyiv region. The situation has encouraged civilians as well as foreign ambassadors  who had evacuated to prepare to return to the Ukrainian capital. Meanwhile, CGTN reporters Zhao Yunfei and Zhou Jiaxin travel from Lviv to Kyiv.
