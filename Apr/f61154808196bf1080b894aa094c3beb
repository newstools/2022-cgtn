Qingming Festival is an important occasion for Chinese to honor their ancestors and pay tribute to the deceased. The love for them is shown with traditional oil-paper umbrellas. Here, artisans in southwest China's Luzhou still use the most traditional techniques, so it has been identified as a national intangible cultural heritage.
