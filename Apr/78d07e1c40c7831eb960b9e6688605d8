Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi said on Saturday Tehran would not give up its right to develop the country's nuclear industry for peaceful purposes. All parties involved in talks to revive the 2015 nuclear accord should respect this right, he added. Indirect talks between Iran and the United States in Vienna have dragged on for 11 months and now are on hold.
