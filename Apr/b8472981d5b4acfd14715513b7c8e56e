Eleven people, including nine schoolteachers, died in a head-on road crash south of Baghdad as they returned from a Ramadan meal, Iraqi authorities said Saturday, blaming speed. The accident happened in Babylon province around midnight as the group was returning in a minibus from the Shiite holy city of Karbala, a police source said. Their vehicle collided with a 4x4 traveling in the opposite direction "due to high speed and the driver of the second vehicle's lack of attention," a statement from the road traffic authorities read, adding two people were injured.
