The first commercial flight out of Yemen's capital in six years was indefinitely postponed Sunday after failing to obtain permits from the Saudi-led coalition, the national carrier said. Yemen's government blamed the Houthi rebel group for the postponement, claiming they had tried to "smuggle" members of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guards Corps and Lebanese militant group Hezbollah onto the flight.
