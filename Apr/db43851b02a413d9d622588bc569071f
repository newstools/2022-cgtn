Zhao Lijian, spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, on Wednesday slammed the unilateral sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies against Russia, saying the move has failed to solve any problems and only made the whole world pay the price. He made the remarks when asked to comment on price increases of food and other bulk commodities and the emergence of food security issues since the Russia-Ukraine conflict broke out.
