Clinical research for the newly-developed vaccine targeting the Omicron variant of COVID-19 will take about three to four months, said an expert from the vaccine's manufacturer, China National Biotec Group (CNBG). Zhang Yuntao, head scientist of CNBG, said in an online presser on Wednesday that the research will likely take place in China's mainland and its Hong Kong Special Administration Region. The new inactivated vaccine was approved for clinical trials on Tuesday. But the exact plan to carry out the trial will not be made before consulting with experts and regulators, Zhang told the media. CNBG is a subsidiary of China National Pharmaceutical Group Corporation (SinoPharm).
