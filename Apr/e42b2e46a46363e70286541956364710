Shanghai reported 268 symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 13,086 asymptomatic COVID-19 cases on April 4, Wu Qianyu, a primary inspector with the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, told media at a press conference on Tuesday. On Monday, Shanghai conducted citywide nucleic acid testings after a mass antigen testing on Sunday. The city has been placed under temporary closed-off management after the rate of COVID-19 infections surged in recent days. As of 8 a.m. on Tuesday, the city has sampled 25.6 million of its residents and collected 2.4 million samples for nucleic acid testing. Among those, 1.9 million samples have been tested, Gu Honghui, deputy secretary-general of Shanghai Municipal People's Government, said during the press conference. Gu said Shanghai currently has a total of 47,700 beds for COVID-19 patients and over 30,000 beds will be put into use. The city has chosen 62 places, including hotels, stadiums and convention centers that meet requirements for temporary transit and quarantine. Shanghai has built 10 emergency warehouses, and has coordinated with 50 extension vegetable production bases and 77 main supply bases and vegetable production areas to ensure the safety of residents' daily lives, said Gu. The local government is also working on solving problems of residents having difficulty accessing medical services during the epidemic. The first batch of recovered patients was discharged from the makeshift hospital of the Shanghai World Expo Exhibition and Convention Center on April 3. Wu said all patients' personal belongings will be disinfected before they leave the hospitals, and the wastes they produced in the hospitals will be disposed as medical wastes. After leaving the hospitals, patients will be transferred back to their places of residence for health monitoring.
