The Weifang International Kite Federation triumphantly flew its "China Space Station" - themed kite to celebrate the return of taikonauts in Weifang city of east China on April 17. The kite's main body is 3.5 meters wide, 8 meters long and 3.8 meters high, with an overall length of 160 meters. It took more than 20 artists two months to complete the motif that depicts the Shenzhou spacecraft docking with the Tiangong space station, and the taikonauts' sortie from the capsule.
