"Chinese culture combined with the elements of ice and snow has fully demonstrated the beauty of nature, culture and sports," Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Friday, praising the Chinese philosophy of harmony reflected in the Beijing 2022 Winter Games at an event in Beijing commending role models for the Winter Games. The concept of a "community of shared future for mankind" ran throughout the brilliant opening and closing ceremonies, Xi said, and a credible, lovable and respectable China in the new era was fully interpreted. The Games drew billions of viewers around the world, making it the most-watched Winter Olympics ever, and won extensive praise from the international community. In addition to the beloved mascots Bing Dwen Dwen and Shuey Rhon Rhon, Xi listed a series of Chinese cultural elements presented at the opening and closing ceremonies, including the 24-solar terms, the Yellow River, Chinese knotting, the Greeting-guests Pine and the symbolic "willow twig" goodbye. "These meaningful scenes have left a deep impression on people's minds, inspiring the Chinese people at home and abroad to unite as one and continue their struggle with high passion," Xi said.
