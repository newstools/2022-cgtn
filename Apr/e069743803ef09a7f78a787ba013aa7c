Two ancient Manchurian catalpa trees are now in full blossom at Dongyue Temple in Hangzhou City, east China's Zhejiang Province. The pink flowers look like sunset clouds enveloping the temple. The trees were said to be 530 years old in 2018, making them 534 today. The Manchurian catalpa tree is native to China and is deemed "the king of a hundred trees." It is often used as an ornamental tree. (All images via CFP) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
