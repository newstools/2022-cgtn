"Pursuing protectionism is like locking oneself in a dark room." In Davos, President Xi Jinping's profound speech in favor of economic globalization resonated powerfully with the world's business community. In London in 2015, he was full of praise for a British student's reading of a Chinese poem. "He recited it better than I could," was the president's warm comment. At the opening ceremony of the 2017 Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, he quoted an ancient Chinese saying: "The longest journey is covered one step at a time." Thus, in erudite terms he explained how the success of the Belt and Road Initiative could be achieved through persistent efforts. On the world stage, President Xi speaks with authority and insight. His words, filled with Chinese wisdom, reveal his far-sighted vision for a world with a shared future.
