Shanghai has set rules for areas where COVID-19 has been eliminated as positive cases in the city continue to fall for five straight days. The city will implement measures around the principles of "limited activities," "a limited number of people" and "limited areas" in places free of the virus, local officials said at Wednesday's press conference. Strict measures such as rigorous COVID-19 testing and complete sanitization will be kept in place for Shanghai's other areas, they said. Positive cases in the eastern Chinese city have fallen steadily since Friday last week, when the case count climbed back to over 200,000 after a brief dip. The authorities reported 1,106 symptomatic cases and 11,959 asymptomatic cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of positive cases to 535,600 since March. Shanghai has become China's epicenter for COVID-19 after an aggressive Omicron outbreak sent cases in the financial hub surging. Much of the city has been in lockdown as local authorities are bent on squashing the virus.
