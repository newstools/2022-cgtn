As the military operation continues, the influx of displaced people on the international community is growing. CGTN Host Tian Wei talked to Matt Saltmarsh, the UNHCR head of news & media. He told CGTN the UNHCR is doing everything they can to help, but it is still far from enough. At least 368,000 people have fled from Ukraine, the United Nations refugee agency said, adding that the number "continues to rise." UN's refugee agency is on the ground and is ready to hand out supply.
