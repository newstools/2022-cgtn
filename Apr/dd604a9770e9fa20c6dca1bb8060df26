China's newly named 20-member national women's volleyball squad will head to Zhangzhou in Fujian Province this weekend to prepare for the World Championship. The roster includes three members of the Rio Olympic gold-medal-winning team – Yuan Xinyue, Gong Xiangyu and Ding Xia. Key players Zhu Ting and Zhang Changning are not on the list due to injuries. New players like Wang Yifan and Miao Yiwen, who had solid performances in the national league, are included. The squad will start training in Zhangzhou on Saturday, gearing up for September's Hangzhou Asian Games in addition to the World Championship.
