"Illegal sanctions on Russian energy will only make Europe more and more dependent on the U.S.," Petr Tolstoy, deputy chairman of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, said in an interview with CGTN on April 18. He added that he is not clear how Europe will emerge from economic problems, but Russia is willing to help them at some point. EU foreign ministers met in Luxembourg on April 11, but they did not decide on sanctions targeting Russia's oil and gas.
