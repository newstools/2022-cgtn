At least seven people died when a goods train derailed in the southeast Democratic Republic of Congo, the second accident in the area in a fortnight, a local official said Monday. The accident occurred in the village of Buyofwe, Lualaba province Saturday. "Seven people died, and 14 were seriously injured" in the latest accident, Lualaba interior minister Deoda Kapenda told AFP Monday, adding the toll could further rise. The eight-wagon train was traveling from Tenke, in Lualaba, to Kananga, in the neighboring province of Kasai-Central. It's not immediately clear how many people were on board when the derailment occurred. (With input from AFP)
