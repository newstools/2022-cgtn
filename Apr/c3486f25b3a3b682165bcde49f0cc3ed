About 130 of mandarin ducks have arrived at the Zhaolin Park of Harbin City, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province. As it is the breeding season for the birds, they are more active than before. The number of female mandarin ducks is less than that of the males, hence it's common to see one female has five chasers. To win a female's heart, the male ducks need to display their feathers and strength. (All images via CFP） (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
