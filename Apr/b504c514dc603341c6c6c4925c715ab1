Chilean police said Wednesday that they have arrested a Portuguese man wanted by Interpol over the 2020 Beirut port blast that killed over 200 people. The man, whose name was not divulged, arrived in Santiago on a flight from Spain, then was put on a plane back to Madrid, according to a police statement. He is wanted for allegedly having brought into Lebanon "explosive elements" with links to the August 2020 explosion, airport police official Christian Saez said. The massive Beirut port explosion devastated entire neighborhoods of the capital. Authorities said the blast was caused by a shipment of ammonium nitrate fertilizer that caught fire after being impounded for years in haphazard conditions.
