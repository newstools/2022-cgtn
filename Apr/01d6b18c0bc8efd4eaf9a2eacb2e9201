Nature is a master of art that has always impressed us with its superlative craftsmanship. On Ulungur Lake in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, ice sculptures in various forms have once again been shaped by wind. The frozen lake has been entering the melting season and the ice surface has broken into pieces in an array of stunning shapes, and then pushed ashore by the strong wind layer by layer. The ice has accumulated and piled up into a series of arched icebergs stretching for tens of kilometers. This awe-inspiring view appears in this area every year around mid-April.
