World No. 3 Alexander Zverev reached the last 16 at the Monte-Carlo Masters after beating Federico Delbonis 6-1, 7-5 on Wednesday, while top seeds including Carlos Alcaraz and Felix Auger-Aliassime crashed out.  Zverev had to resist a tough comeback from Delbonis after an easy first set in which he dropped only three points on serve. With a deficit of 4-2 in the second set, Zverev took 11 points straight to overturn the match before converting his third match point. "This is the only Masters on clay that I haven't won. I'm very motivated to do that and hope I can show it on court this week," Zverev said in a post-match interview. Earlier on Wednesday, Miami Open champion Alcaraz lost to unseeded Sebastian Korda 7-6(2), 6-7(5), 6-3 over three hours.  Alcaraz, 18, said after the defeat that the result had nothing to do with the pressure of others' expectations.  "I had a lot of chances to be up in the match and close to winning, but these losses sometimes [are] good to live. You have to play matches," Alcaraz said.  "But I didn't think about the expectations that the people have [for] me. I just focused on me and what I have to do. But as I said, you have to play more matches on clay courts," he added.  In other second-round matches on Wednesday, Auger-Aliassime lost to Lorenzo Mussett 6-2, 7-6(2), Andrey Rublev prevailed 2-6, 6-1, 6-4 over Alex de Minaur, Casper Ruud beat Holger Rune 7-6(5), 7-5, and Jannik Sinner moved past Emil Ruusuvuori 7-5,6-3.
