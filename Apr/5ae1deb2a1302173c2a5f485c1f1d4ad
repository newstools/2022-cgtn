Russia claims that the Ukrainian government is not allowing its forces in Mariupol to negotiate for surrender. Ukraine says it's preparing final defense as Russia seeks to "destroy" Donbas. A second British soldier fighting with the Ukrainian army has been paraded on Russian television after being captured. The soldiers have asked Boris Johnson to exchange them for pro-Russian Ukrainian politician Viktor Medvedchuk.
