German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said NATO's top priority is to avoid a direct military confrontation with Russia that could lead to a Third World War. Scholz was quoted by Der Spiegel in an interview published Friday when he was asked why Germany failed to deliver heavy weapons to Ukraine. He also said an embargo on Russian gas imports would not end the conflict but significantly impact Germany and Europe.
