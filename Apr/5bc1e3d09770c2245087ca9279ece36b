China will take active measures to help foreign-funded enterprises resume work and production, the Ministry of Commerce said on Thursday. The recent outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is relatively frequent and wide-ranging and has had a certain impact on the production and operation of domestic and foreign-funded enterprises, the ministry's spokesperson Shu Jueting told reporters at a press conference. "The Chinese government has attached great importance to the operation of foreign-funded enterprises in the country amid the pandemic and formed special work groups for the key foreign-funded projects," Shu said. "The commerce ministry, together with relevant departments and local governments, will help enterprises, especially foreign-funded enterprises in key pandemic areas, tackle specific problems in the resumption of work and production, entry of personnel, logistics and transportation," Shu said. In response to the new situation and problems reported by foreign-funded enterprises, the ministry will help coordinate and solve them in a timely manner to ensure stable and orderly business operation, Shu said.
