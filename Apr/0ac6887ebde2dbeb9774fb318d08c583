British Home Secretary Priti Patel issued a "ministerial direction" to push through a plan to send refugees from the UK to Rwanda, which means she has to take personal responsibility for it, according to Sky News. The UK signed an agreement with Rwanda on Thursday to send illegal immigrants to the landlocked African country. Under the British government plan, people deemed to have entered the UK illegally since January 1, 2022, will be sent to Rwanda. The United Nations' refugee agency voiced its strong opposition, with Gillian Triggs, the UNHCR assistant high commissioner for protection saying: "People fleeing war, conflict and persecution deserve compassion and empathy. They should not be traded like commodities and transferred abroad for processing."
