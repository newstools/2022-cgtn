Young Chinese people have increasingly diverse and market-oriented career choices as times change, according to a national white paper titled "Youth of China in the New Era" released on Thursday. The tertiary industry has become an important gathering place for the young workforce. In 2020, the tertiary industry accounted for 47.7 percent of those employed across the country, up by 13.1 percentage points from a decade ago. New and rapidly rising industries and new business forms have given birth to a large number of new career positions, such as e-sports players, livestream hosts and web writers, and engaged a large number of young people in flexible employments such as parcel and food deliveries. The government has introduced a series of policies to support flexible employment through multiple channels and gradually improved the social security services for those engaged in such employment. Chinese youths now look beyond a stable lifelong job in the traditional sense, and non-public economic entities and new social organizations are gradually becoming their main channels for employment.
