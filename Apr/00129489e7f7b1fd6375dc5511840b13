After the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) came into force in Malaysia on March 18, Kuala Lumpur started to remove tariffs on about 90 percent of goods. At the juncture of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), CGTN's Dai Kaiyi spoke to the ambassador of Malaysia to China, Raja Dato' Nushirwan Zainal Abidin, on the economic ties between the two countries. The ambassador thinks the globalization phenomenon will not go away and that RCEP will strengthen regional supply chains. He hopes that the BFA will be an important gathering for the facilitation of dialogue as the world tries to mitigate the fallout from the challenging geostrategic environment at the present moment.
