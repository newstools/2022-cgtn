On April 24, France will witness a tightly fought election runoff. Although Emmanuel Macron has secured 27.6 percent of the vote at the first round, his percentage is merely 4 percent higher than Marine Le Pen. Given that one of the issues facing the country is the Ukraine war, a question that begs an answer is how will the crisis shape the outcome of the election? And how will the election influence the direction of the European Union's economy? Former policy adviser at the European Parliament, Song Xin, says that if Le Pen wins and becomes the president, it might have a severe impact on the EU's political and economic structure, opening up a new rift after a show of unity recently.
