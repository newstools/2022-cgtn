China's Olympic champion diver Cao Yuan has been preparing for his fourth consecutive Olympic Games at Paris 2024. The 27-year-old has won three golds and two silvers in the past three editions of the games, in London, Rio and Tokyo. And a gold in 3-meter synchronized springboard event would make Cao a record-setting diver by winning all four men's singles and synchronized events in Olympic history.Cao competed in platform events during the London Olympics before switching to springboard in Rio. During the Tokyo Games, he competed in both springboard and platform events. Looking ahead, Cao will concentrate on springboard events for Paris 2024. But he endured a setback with his left shoulder in February, re-aggravating an injury he previously suffered before Tokyo. So his priority is to prevent another re-occurrence while increasing strength. The three-time Olympic champion has turned his full attention to making history in the French capital just a bit over two years away.
