China on Monday unveiled guidelines to further tap into the country's consumption potential, offering detailed measures to tackle short-term bottlenecks and boost longer-term consumption. The country plans to build a batch of warehouses in the suburbs of large- and medium-sized cities to ensure the supply of daily necessities in case of emergencies, according to the guidelines released by the General Office of the State Council. The guidelines also specify other measures to cope with the impact of COVID-19 and boost consumption. Encouraging regions to carry out free regular nucleic acid tests for employees in industries such as retail and catering, the guidelines suggest providing subsidies to enterprises to facilitate their COVID-19 prevention and control efforts. The guidelines also call for reducing taxes and fees for small and micro enterprises, besides promoting the financial system to support the real economy through measures such as lowering of interest rates.
