At least 213 people were killed in three days of violence between Arab and non-Arab groups in Sudan's West Darfur, the state governor said, giving the first official toll for recent clashes. West Darfur has been gripped by days of deadly fighting largely centered in Krink, a locality of nearly 500,000 people and mostly inhabited by the African Massalit tribe. "This massive crime left around 201 killed and 103 wounded" on Sunday alone, said West Darfur Governor Khamees Abkar in a video published late Tuesday. The violence first broke out on Friday and escalated when armed men attacked villages of the non-Arab Massalit in retaliation for the killing of two tribesmen, according to the General Coordination for Refugees and Displaced in Darfur, an independent aid group.
