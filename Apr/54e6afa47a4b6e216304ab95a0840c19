The National Stadium in Beijing, also known as the "Bird's Nest," launched the trial operation of a "Dual-Olympic" themed tourism route on Wednesday, which will officially open to visitors for the upcoming five-day May Day holiday. Beijing is the world's first city to have held both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games, and the stadium, initially designed for the 2008 Summer Olympics and Paralympics, was put into use again during the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The tourism route links nearly 10 sightseeing spots, where visitors will be able to tour the main stage of the Games' opening and closing ceremonies and learn about the cutting-edge technologies behind the visual feasts, and climb onto the highest point of the stadium to get a closer look at how the fireworks were set off and overlook the panoramic view of the city's Olympic Park. In response to the current COVID-19 epidemic, the stadium implements strict epidemic prevention policies to create a safe travel environment for tourists. Visitors are also required to pass temperature checks and present a green health code before entry. The stadium will be open daily from 9 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. during the trial operation.
