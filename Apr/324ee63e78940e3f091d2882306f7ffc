Shehbaz Sharif, leader of the opposition in Pakistan's National Assembly, was elected as the country's new prime minister on Monday. Securing 174 votes from the 342-seat assembly, Sharif became the 23rd Pakistani prime minister, ending a week-long constitutional confrontation that climaxed on Sunday when former Prime Minister Imran Khan lost no-confidence vote.
