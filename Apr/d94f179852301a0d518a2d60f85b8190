Although technically carnivores, red pandas have turned "vegetarian," mainly feeding on bamboo shoots and leaves, sometimes fruits and flowers. They spend most of their lives on trees and live alongside giant pandas in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province. There are now two distinct red panda species: the Chinese red panda and the Himalayan red panda. They look almost the same. However, Chinese red pandas have redder fur and striped tail rings, while Himalayan pandas have whiter faces. In China, red pandas mostly inhabit southwest China's Sichuan and Yunnan provinces and Tibet Autonomous Region. As the only species remaining in their taxonomic family, red pandas are worth attention and protection. They are now under second-class state protection in China.
