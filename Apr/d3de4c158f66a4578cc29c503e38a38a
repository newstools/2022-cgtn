Iranian Minister of Roads and Urban Development Rostam Ghasemi met with visiting Qatari Minister of Transport and Communications Jassim bin Saif Al Sulaiti on Kish Island on Sunday. Iran's support will include providing accommodation, air and maritime transportation for passengers and tourists destined for Qatar, with one million visitors estimated when the Qatar World Cup takes place from November 21 to December 18.
