The U.S. House of Representatives passed a bill on Wednesday that would allow confiscated foreign assets to be used to support Ukraine. The legislation, dubbed the Asset Seizure for Ukraine Reconstruction Act, passed in a 417-8 vote. The bill urges U.S. President Joe Biden to seize and confiscate assets belonging to foreign individuals whose wealth was in part acquired "through corruption linked to or political support for Russian President Vladimir Putin and with respect to which the President has imposed sanctions."
