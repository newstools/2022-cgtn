The Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC) cannot account for 168 people following an attack on a train last week in which at least eight people were killed and 26 injured, the company has said. The train was attacked by militants on March 28 while traveling between Kuduna state and the capital Abuja. In a statement, Managing Director Fidet Okhiria did not specify whether NRC staff are among the missing. No group has yet claimed responsibility for the attack. (With input from Reuters)
