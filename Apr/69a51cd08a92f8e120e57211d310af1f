China has provided a great amount of support to other countries regarding COVID-19 control and prevention. Here's what we've learned as of mid-April. The world's second largest economy has provided 2.2 billion shots of COVID-19 vaccines to more than 120 countries, regions and international organizations, according to Zhang Jun, ambassador and permanent representative to the United Nations (UN). Zhang said at a UN press conference on April 11 that China has also provided 220 millions shots to COVAX, the international initiative aimed at providing equal access to COVID-19 vaccines. In addition to providing vaccines, China also offered the know-how of mass-producing the shots to countries including but not limited to Brazil, Egypt and Uzbekistan. The localized production helped solve the vaccine shortage in those countries. As the first country to embrace the attack of the deadly and highly-contagious virus, China accumulated precious first-hand knowledge of COVID-19, shared the genetic sequence with the world as soon as possible and kept offering patient data to help researchers around the world understand the disease. In addition to providing vaccines and information, China has sent dozens of medical expert groups to other countries, directly sharing the Chinese experience of fighting against the pandemic. According to a report from People's Daily, China has also provided a huge amount of medical equipment to the international community, including 372 billion masks, 4.2 billion protective suits and 8.4 billion COVID-19 test kits. As the global economy suffers from pandemic-related problems, China has promised to offer $3 billion of aid to developing countries in the next three years in order to restore normal market activities.
