After successfully hosting the Winter Olympics and Paralympics earlier this year, China will welcome another international sporting event in less than two months. This time, the global attention will be drawn to Chengdu City, capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, which will host the Universiade from June 26 to July 7 after a year of postponement due to the pandemic. The tournament, set to gather young athletes from universities around the world, is themed at "Chengdu Makes Dreams Come True". Here is a collection of images to show the latest preparations for the event.
