A Falcon 9 spacecraft lifted off from Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. About 8.5 minutes later, the rocket's first stage returned to Earth and landed on the SpaceX drone ship, which was stationed in the Atlantic Ocean off the Florida coast. It was the sixth liftoff and landing for this Falcon first stage, according to a SpaceX mission description. The booster also helped launch two GPS satellites, another Starlink batch and two pioneering private crewed missions. SpaceX has launched nearly 2,400 Starlink satellites to date, 10 of the company's 17 launches so far this year have been dedicated Starlink missions.
