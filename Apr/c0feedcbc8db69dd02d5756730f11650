Shanghai will conduct another round of citywide COVID-19 nucleic acid tests, Zong Ming, vice mayor of Shanghai, said at a press conference on Saturday. She added that based on the test results, the city's different areas would be classified into three types of zones – lockdown, control and precaution – and differentiated prevention and control measures will be implemented according to the risk levels. Shanghai reported 1,015 symptomatic COVID-19 cases and 22,609 asymptomatic cases on April 8, Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said during the press conference. The city has been placed under temporary closed-off management after the new COVID-19 infection surge in recent days. Some residents have reported difficulties obtaining medicines. Wu said neighborhood committees will work with local medical institutions to collect requirements of residents in closed-off areas, and arrange volunteers to fill out prescriptions for people with common or chronic diseases. Residents can also visit doctors and fill out prescriptions through the city's online hospital networks. Shanghai has granted internet hospital qualifications to 85 medical institutions. The delivery time of medicines has been extended due to the containment and disinfection of warehouses, quarantine of delivery personnel and other factors. Wu said the city has stepped up efforts to restore the capacity of logistics platforms as soon as possible. Presently, Shanghai has eight designated hospitals with over 8,000 beds for COVID-19 patients. More than 100 mobile cabin hospitals have been built with over 160,000 beds, Zong said at the press conference.
