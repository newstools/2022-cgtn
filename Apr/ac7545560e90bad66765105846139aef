Nikola Jokic overcame a gash on his head to finish with 35 points and 16 rebounds while grabbing a piece of NBA history as the host Denver Nuggets beat the Memphis Grizzlies 122-109 to clinch a top-six spot in the Western Conference playoffs. Jokic became the first NBA player to compile 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds and 500 assists in a season. Aaron Gordon had 22 points, Bones Hyland and Will Barton scored 16 apiece and Monte Morris had 10 for the Nuggets, who won for the fifth time in seven games. Desmond Bane netted 14 points to lead seven Memphis players in double-figures scoring. The Grizzlies, who are second in the West, have dropped two in a row after an 11-1 stretch. Golden State Warriors 128-112 Los Angeles Lakers Klay Thompson continued a hot stretch with a team-high 33 points and host Golden State rallied late in the third quarter to defeat superstar-depleted Los Angeles in San Francisco. Jordan Poole saw a 17-game run of 20-point performances come to an end, but he posted 19 points and 11 assists for the Warriors, who increased their lead over the Dallas Mavericks to a full game with two remaining in the battle for the No. 3 playoff seed in the West. Playing without LeBron James, Anthony Davis, Russell Westbrook and Carmelo Anthony, the Lakers got a career-high 40 points from Talen Horton-Tucker in a surprisingly competitive effort in the wake of playoff elimination two nights earlier. Los Angeles lost its eighth straight game.
