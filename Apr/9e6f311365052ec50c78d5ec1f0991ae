Iran's Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said on Sunday that an agreement is "close" in paused negotiations to restore the 2015 nuclear deal between Tehran and world powers. "We are close to an agreement in the negotiations," Amir-Abdollahian said during a phone conversation with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, according to a statement by the ministry. "We have passed on our proposals on the remaining issues to the American side through the EU senior negotiator, and now the ball is in the U.S. court," Iran's top diplomat added.
