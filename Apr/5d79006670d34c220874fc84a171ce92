Did you know that bamboo can be used to make wine? Yang Guifei, a 28-year-old woman from the Miao ethnic community of Huilong Village, Chishui City of southwest China's Guizhou Province, knows and used it to start a business in her hometown in 2016. To produce bamboo wine, wine is first injected into the hollow cavity of a planted bamboo and left there for 4 to 6 months. The secondary fermentation in the bamboo creates a change in the color and texture of the wine. Yang traveled to other provinces, such as east China's Fujian and central China's Hunan, multiple times to learn how to master the craft of making bamboo wine. She currently rents hundreds of hectares of bamboo forests from surrounding villagers to make the wine. After the wine is harvested, the bamboo is sold by villagers to the market, thereby increasing their income. Yang has led her village along the path to wealth with her entrepreneurship.
