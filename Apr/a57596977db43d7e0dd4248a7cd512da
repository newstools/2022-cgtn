As fighting in Ukraine worsens, so does the dire humanitarian situation on the ground. Enough aid reaching refugees? For more on what's really happening on the ground, CGTN Host Tian Wei talked to Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, who arrived in Kyiv on March 16 on a planned five-day visit, to call for greater humanitarian access and better protection of civilians. He told Tian Wei that the ICRC will spend 250 million Swiss Francs to aid the Ukrainian humanitarian crisis. It will bring in the pipeline of goods and increase cash contributions to displaced populations.
