Chinese research icebreaker Xuelong, or Snow Dragon, returned to Shanghai on Tuesday, marking the end of the country's 38th Antarctic expedition. The 174-day expedition, which set off in November last year, was a joint undertaking of Xuelong and sister vessel Xuelong 2 which arrived in Shanghai six days ago. Team members, including 255 researchers, replenished supplies at China's Zhongshan Station and Great Wall Station in the Antarctic region and completed staff rotations. They also conducted hydrological, meteorological and environmental investigations in the South Pole and cooperated on replenishment with other countries, with officials reporting fruitful results. It was the second time China had sent two icebreakers to the Antarctic at the same time since the 36th polar expedition.
