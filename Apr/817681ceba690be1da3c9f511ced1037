Mali's ruling junta on Thursday announced the launch of a two-year transition "process" before elections. The military seized power in August 2020 and has been under pressure to return the nation to democratic rule. In March, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) demanded the organization of elections within 12 to 16 months. But the bloc's mediation has failed to persuade Mali to limit the transition period.
