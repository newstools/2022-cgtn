At the BWF World Tour Korea Open, China's 22-year-old Weng Hongyang secured a semifinal spot after upsetting Malaysia's promising talent Ng Tze Yong 2-0 (21-11, 21-12) on Friday. Ranked at only World No.152 and without much international competition experience, Weng is the only Chinese player remaining at the tournament, surprising the audience. The dark horse will clash against Dane Victor Svendsen in the semifinal, who defeated Shesar Hiren Rhustavito of Indonesia 2-0. In the mixed doubles, China's Ou Xuanyi and Huang Yaqiong crashed out as they lost to Malaysian pair Tan Kian Meng and Lai Pei Jing 18-21, 17-21. Earlier, China's Olympic champion Chen Yufei and her compatriot Wang Zhiyi were ousted in the women's singles round of 16. World No. 7 PV Sindhu, a two-time Olympics medalist from India, will encounter local player An Se-young in the semifinal.
