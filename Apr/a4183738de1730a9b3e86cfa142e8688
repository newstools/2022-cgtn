The death toll from landslides and flooding in the Philippines triggered by tropical storm Megi reached 123 on Thursday, official figures showed. However, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council reported only 76 deaths and 29 people missing. The agency, which culls reports from the provinces affected by disasters, said it is verifying the number of casualties. Police Colonel Ma. Bella Rentuaya, spokesperson for the national police in the Eastern Visayas region, said as of Thursday, 113 have died from landslides and floods in the region. She said in a report that 81 people died in landslides in Baybay City, 31 in Abuyog town in Leyte province, and one person in Samar province. Five more are missing, and at least 236 people were injured in the storm, she said. Megi, which hit land last Sunday, is the first tropical storm this year to hit the Southeast Asian country, which is battered by about 20 typhoons and storms every year. The Philippines archipelago lies on the Pacific typhoon belt, making it one of the world's most disaster-prone countries. (With input from agencies)
