A total of six space flight missions will be carried out in 2022 to complete the in-orbit construction of China's space station, a Chinese space official said at a news conference on Sunday. A Tianzhou-4 cargo spacecraft will first be launched in May, said Hao Chun, director of the China Manned Space Engineering Office, adding that the Shenzhou-14 manned spacecraft will be launched in June, with three astronauts in the core module and stationed in orbit for six months. The Wentian lab module will dock with the Tianhe core module in July. The Mengtian lab module will be docked with the core module in October to complete the in-orbit construction of China's space station. A T-shaped complex will be formed once construction of the space station is completed. The Tianzhou-5 cargo spacecraft and the Shenzhou-15 manned spacecraft will then follow, taking another three astronauts to stay in orbit for six months. The chief designer of the astronaut system for China's manned space project, Huang Weifen, told CGTN that the Shenzhou-14 and Shenzhou-15 crews are actively being trained for a series of missions, including the assembly and operation of different modules on the space station, robotic arms tests and extravehicular activities (EVAs). The astronauts will perform EVAs through a dedicated airlock module. It will also be the first time for the station to host six astronauts at the same time for up to 10 days. Hao said in the briefing that COVID-19 has not affected the construction timeline of China's space station.
