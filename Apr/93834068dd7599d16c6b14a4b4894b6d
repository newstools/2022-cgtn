The long-distance group of China's track cycling national team has completed a week-long physical tests at Beijing Sports University, as an important part of the group's selection process of athletes for this summer's Hangzhou Asian Games. Members of the group were tested to confirm their basic body conditions and event-related physical quality. Specialized facilities are applied in the tests to assess their average power output, maximum explosive power and endurance. The contents are based on the suggestions of coach Tim Decker, who thinks Chinese athletes have good body condition but need to improve their technique, such as their riding posture, track-change strategy and ability to analyze the competition. After the physical tests, the group will undergo two weeks of trial training at western Beijing's Laoshan track cycling velodrome, venue for the track cycling competitions in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games.
