UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres met with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday. Guterres said he had come to the Russian capital as a "messenger of peace." He said he hopes to improve the humanitarian situation in Ukraine and encourages moves to end the conflict. Lavrov presented his thoughts on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. He thought it was only due to the U.S. pressure that countries had either abstained or voted with Washington to declare Russia's special military operation illegal.
