Chinese lawmakers adopted plans Wednesday for a quota distribution for the 14th National People's Congress (NPC) deputy election, as the tenure of current lawmakers expires in March 2023. According to the plans, no more than 3,000 deputies should be elected to the 14th NPC, with 36 from Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and 12 from Macao Special Administrative Region. Taiwan will have 13 deputies for the time being, to be elected by a 126-strong group consisting of Taiwan compatriots from provincial-level regions, central departments and the People's Liberation Army. The plans were adopted at the closing meeting of the 34th session of the Standing Committee of the 13th NPC. The session opened on Monday. During the closing meeting, laws on futures and derivatives and a revision to the Vocational Education Law were also approved. Deputies to the 14th NPC will be elected in January 2023, according to China's Constitution and relevant laws. Li Zhanshu, chairman of the NPC Standing Committee, presided over the meeting.
