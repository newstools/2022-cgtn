The Russian Defense Ministry says that its troops have destroyed the command post of a Ukrainian mechanized brigade and an ammunition warehouse in a city in the Luhansk region, eastern Ukraine. In other parts of the east, air raid sirens were sounded. The governor of the Donetsk region on Sunday said shelling continued throughout, night and day. Further north of Donetsk, the Ukrainian regional prosecutor's office said Russian shelling killed seven people in Kharkiv. In the early hours of Monday, explosions were heard in Kherson and the coastal city of Odesa. British military intelligence said heavy fighting continues in the besieged port city of Mariupol. Meanwhile, the EU said Monday it is considering a new round of sanctions on Russia as it condemned alleged atrocities committed by Russian troops in the town of Bucha outside the capital Kyiv. EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the bloc will discuss the sanctions urgently. Despite the threats of new sanctions, Russia has maintained gas flows through key pipeline routes into Europe on Monday. Moscow has insisted that payment for the gas be made in rubles. Slovakia's Prime Minister confirmed over the weekend that his country will act in unison with the European Union against such payment demands. Ukraine's deputy prime minister says the country has evacuated more than two thousand and six hundred people from conflict zones of Mariupol and the eastern region of Luhansk.
