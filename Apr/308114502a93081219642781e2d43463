The Winter Olympics Culture Experience event has been underway at China's National Aquatics Center since April 16. The venue, also known as "Water Cube" and more recently "Ice Cube," welcomed 19,000 visitors in the first nine days, with close to 10,000 enjoying the interactive curling exhibition. The Center's first public event since the end of the Beijing Winter Paralympics will run through May 15. The open area maintains its appearance from the 2022 Games to provide visitors with an immersive experience. The press zone and athlete locker rooms are also open to the public. China won the wheelchair curling gold during the Paralympics, and visitors can view team uniforms signed by the athletes and the equipment they used during the competition.
