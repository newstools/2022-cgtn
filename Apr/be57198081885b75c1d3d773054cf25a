Liverpool, Real Madrid and Manchester City are in a very advantageous position after defeating their opponents in the first leg of the UEFA Champions League quarterfinals on Tuesday and Wednesday. Benfica hardly put up enough resistance in their 3-1 loss to Liverpool at Estadio da Luz on Tuesday. Karim Benzema scored his second straight hat trick in the Champions League to help Real leave Stamford Bridge with a 3-1 win over Chelsea on Wednesday. Though City only had a 1-0 win over Atletico Madrid at City of Manchester Stadium on Tuesday, they won't have too much to worry about in the second-leg game unless manager Diego Simeone figures out an offensive solution. Bayern Munich were upset by Villarreal 1-0 at Estadio de la Ceramica on Wednesday. The process was actually a lot uglier than the result could show because "The Yellow Submarine" missed at least another four good chances to score.
