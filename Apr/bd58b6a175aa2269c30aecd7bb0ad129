China on Monday doubled down on its "dynamic zero-COVID" policy, citing scientific advice and also acknowledging potential economic costs from some production halts. According to Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin, such policy "goes in line with China's current situation and the guiding principles of the World Health Organization." These measures "have effectively guaranteed the safety and health of Chinese and foreign citizens living in China," he said during a press briefing. Apart from treating COVID-19 patients, the country has carried out mass nucleic acid tests - or in some cases, partial lockdowns in some areas- to detect hidden infections alongside stringent traveling restrictions. As China grapples with flare-ups of the Omicron variant in the country's financial hub Shanghai, the capital of Beijing has also seen infection spike. The capital's Chaoyang District has ordered its 3.5 million residents to undergo three coronavirus tests this week. "Data shows that the death rate of COVID-19 cases in China in 2021 is 0.4 cases per 100,000, only 1/606 of the United States," Wang said. "And China is one of the countries with the lowest COVID-19 death across the world." Wang said most Chinese "understand and support the country's prevention measures," adding they are filled with confidence in the fight against the virus.
