Indonesia's navy said on Thursday it seized two tankers carrying crude palm oil, palm olein, and methanol for what it called permit and paperwork violations, in an operation conducted a day before a palm oil export ban took effect. MT World Progress violated vessel specifications in its travel document, while the other ship, MT Annabelle carried methanol without a permit, said the navy, which has been deployed to enforce the export ban, which took effect midnight Wednesday.
