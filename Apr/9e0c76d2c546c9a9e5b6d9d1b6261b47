Bird lover Fang Qiaoran captured a romantic moment between a black-winged stilt couple during a field survey in south China. The bird's long legs resemble wooden stilts, and it's called the "red-legged lady" in China because of the pink color of its legs. Fang recorded 55 bird species during the survey. Check out some of the image's from Fang's collection.
