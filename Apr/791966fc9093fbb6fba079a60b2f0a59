In Temple of Heaven Park in Beijing, birds were seen feeding and flying in the flowers and trees on Thursday, creating a picture full of life. A light-vented bulbul with white fur on its head flew into the trees to enjoy a special delicacy: the juice from the branches. Some birds rested amid flowers, or on the branches with flower buds, bathing in the spring air. (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
