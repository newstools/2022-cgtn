The Colorado Rockies and their left-handed pitcher Kyle Freeland agreed on a contract extension, the team announced on Tuesday without disclosing financial details. ESPN revealed that it's a five-year, $64.5 million deal that will keep Freeland for the Rockies until at least 2026 and include the most guaranteed money in team history for a pitcher since they signed the eight-year, $121 million contract with Mike Hampton in 2000. "He's pitching well here. He's comfortable here," Rockies manager Bud Black said on Tuesday. "There's something to growing up here. ... It doesn't bother him. I've seen pitchers in my career be bothered by it. He's not." Freeland was drafted by the Rockies with the eighth-overall pick in 2014 and he was considered a top prospect. His major league career began in April 2017, achieving an 11-11 record in that season. Freeland exploded in the 2018 season with 17-7 and earned a run average (ERA) of 2.83, the best of his career, during 202⅓ innings. He was fourth in the National League Cy Young voting that season. The following three seasons were rough for Freeland as he slipped. Last year, he missed the first two months of the season due to a shoulder injury. Fortunately for both him and the Rockies, Freeland bounced back in his last 18 starting games during which he pitched a 3.24 ERA in 100 innings. Though the Rockies finished the 2021 season 74-87 and failed to make the playoffs, they were convinced that they should keep Freeland with over $80 million of guaranteed money. The Rockies have already kept two pitchers with long-term deals. Back in 2019, they gave right-hander German Marquez a five-year, $43 million contract that includes a team option in 2024. Antonio Senzatela received a five-year, $50.5 million deal that includes a club option in 2027. In March, the team also signed third baseman Ryan McMahon on a six-year, $70 million extension. The MLB doesn't have a salary cap at the moment. With all of their players under contract right now, the Rockets are looking at a payroll of over $100 million for next season.
