Editor's note: Hidden World of Birds in City is about exploring a world of birds that usually go unnoticed in urban spaces. This episode features photographs from Wang Xiaobo, who has been bird-watching near his residential community in Beijing for the past eight years. As spring slowly unfolds, migratory birds have started making an appearance in the Chinese capital. The number and variety of these passersby peak in May, when spotting them even in some residential communities becomes possible. Photographer Wang Xiaobo said that it was the first time for him to see such a large number of Mongolian gulls in the area, although the species is not a rare guest. Have a look at the photos he took of migratory birds.
