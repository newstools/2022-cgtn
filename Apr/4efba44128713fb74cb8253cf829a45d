Chen Jian lives in the "Aijian Garden" residential community in Shanghai. During the COVID-19 epidemic, most communities have been placed under lockdown. To cheer up the neighborhood, Chen organized a "balcony" concert, in which residents spontaneously sang inspirational songs from their balconies. In the video, Chen Jian and his friends talk about the reasons why they organized the concert, the difficulties they encountered, and the support and help they received.
