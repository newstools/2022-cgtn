A 14-member Chinese expedition team is setting up eight automated meteorological stations at extremely high altitudes on Mount Qomolangma in China's Tibet Autonomous Region. There are four stations above the 7,000-meter mark up the world's tallest mountain, at 7,028 meters, 7,790 meters, 8,300 meters and 8,800 meters, respectively. The stations at 7,790 meters and 8,300 meters above sea level have been installed successfully. Zhao Huabiao, a researcher with the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said, "If the automatic meteorological station is installed successfully at the altitude of 8,800 meters, it will be the highest-altitude meteorological observation facility in the world."
