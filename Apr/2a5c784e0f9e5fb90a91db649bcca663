Premier League leaders Manchester City took a 4-3 lead over Real Madrid after the Champions League semifinal first-leg match at the Etihad Stadium on Tuesday. City's Kevin De Bruyne scored the fastest goal in the history of the event's semifinals, giving his team the lead only 94 seconds into the game with a superb cross delivered by teammate Riyad Mahrez. The hosts doubled the lead in the 11th minute with a goal from Gabriel Jesus, who capitalized on a pass from De Bruyne. Real Madrid's Karim Benzema scored the first of his double, guiding a Ferland Mendy cross into the far bottom corner with the most delicate of steers in the 33rd minute. He contributed a late penalty eight minutes before the match ended, but the visitors could not draw level. City led throughout but were challenged constantly by Real Madrid in a seven-goal thriller which left much uncertainty ahead of the highly anticipated second leg next week. (With input from Reuters)
