The country will issue sufficient travel permits that can be recognized across the nation and make sure that nucleic acid test results within 48 hours can be used in different regions, according to the meeting. Authorities should not restrict travels on the grounds of waiting for drivers' nucleic acid test results, according to the meeting. The country will leverage funds to help stabilize supply and industrial chains, and will also create a "white list" of foreign trade firms and companies in the automobile, medical and other key sectors, according to the meeting.
