Manchester City reached the 2021-22 UEFA Champions League semifinals after a very physical 0-0 against Atletico Madrid at Wanda Metropolitano on Wednesday. Nine yellow cards and one red one were given, and Kevin de Bruyne, Phil Foden and Kyle Walker of City were injured. Chelsea came close to reversing the situation when Timo Werner made it 3-0 for the team at Stamford Bridge on Tuesday night. However, Rodrygo's goal for Real Madrid put the two teams back at the same starting line before Karim Benzema again played hero for Real. City and Real will meet each other in the semifinals. Bayern Munich seem to have run out their luck. Robert Lewandowski's goal gave the Bundesliga powerhouse some hope, but they should have watched out for Samuel Chukwueze when he scored the precious goal for Villarreal at Allianz Arena on Tuesday. "The Yellow Submarine" will in the semifinals challenge Liverpool, which sidelined seven starters but still didn't last to Benfica at Anfield on Wednesday night.
