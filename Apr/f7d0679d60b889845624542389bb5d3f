It has been a while since the Phoenix Suns, and Memphis Grizzlies led the NBA Western Conference. The two teams will for sure finish the 2021-22 regular season as the top 2. The Suns are one win away from setting a new franchise record of victories in the regular season. The Golden State Warriors, Dallas Mavericks and Denver Nuggets are likely to finish as third, fourth and fifth in the conference. The big question is: which team will have home advantage in the first round? Mavericks or Nuggets? The Utah Jazz are currently sixth, but they have to watch out for the following Minnesota Timberwolves to catch up if the Jazz cannot calm things down in the locker room. The Los Angeles Clippers, New Orleans Pelicans and San Antonio Spurs seem to lock their spots for the play-in tournament, while the Los Angeles Lakers are two losses away from finishing the 2021-22 campaign with nothing.
