Flocks of migratory birds have reached the Sugan Lakes in Aksay Kazak Autonomous County of northwest China's Gansu Province. With the ice melting and temperatures going up, the wetland's environment is now a resting spot for different migratory birds, including state-protected species such as the white swans and bar-headed gooses. It also attracted many visitors to enjoy the spectacular scenery. Serving as the habitat to hundreds of thousands of birds, the county has stepped up efforts to conserve the grassland and wetland and provide a better living environment for them. As a result, the number of birds is reportedly increasing on an annual basis. (Cover image via VCG) (If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at nature@cgtn.com.)
