Manchester United have confirmed that interim boss Ralf Rangnick has signed a two-year contract with the Austrian Football Association to be their national team's head coach, but will continue as a consultant to the Premier League giants. The 63-year-old is set to start his new job at the end of May, once his stint at Old Trafford is over. His Austria deal will automatically be extended by a further two years should the team qualify for Euro 2024. "I will take over as national team manager of Austria at the end of the season but will continue my consultancy with Manchester United," Rangnick said in a statement. "It is an honor for me to take on the role of manager. The prospect of contesting the European Championships in Germany with a young team hungry for success fills me with great anticipation." Since Rangnick replaced Ole Gunnar Solskjaer in November, United have won only 10 of their 25 games in all competitions. They are languishing in sixth in the league table, five points behind Arsenal in fourth spot. However, Austria still consider the German tactician as the right person to lead their promising national team. "We are very pleased that we were able to win an outstanding expert in international football as team boss," said Gerhard Milletich, president of the Austrian Football Association. "We are all convinced that he is the ideal man and that his vision will advance the national team."
