Yemeni President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi has issued a decree sacking his deputy Ali Mohsen al-Ahmar, local media reported on Thursday. The president also delegated his own powers to a presidential council that will carry out leadership duties. The new body will assume the duties of both the president and his deputy, said the announcement issued in the name of Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The new council will carry out political, military and security duties for the Yemeni government during what it refers to as a "transitional period." (With input from Reuters)
