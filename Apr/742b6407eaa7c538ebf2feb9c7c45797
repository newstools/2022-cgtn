China's COVID-19 containment policy during the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics provided beneficial experience for global anti-pandemic efforts and the hosting of major international events, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Friday. Xi made the remarks at a ceremony commending role models who made outstanding contributions to the Beijing 2022 Games. Against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, China prioritized the health of all the participants in the Games, and took targeted and effective measures which withstood the test to ensure a safe and smooth Winter Games, Xi said. Throughout the Games, only 0.45 percent of the personnel within the closed loop tested positive for the coronavirus, and all of them received effective treatment and good care, he said, adding that no cluster infections or virus spillover occurred, and the cities hosting the Games achieved dynamic clearance of the virus. The Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics was held from February 4 to February 20 and the Winter Paralympics took place from March 4 to March 13, making them the first Winter Games held amidst a pandemic. Strict measures were taken to ensure the safety of the athletes, officials, media members, spectators and working staff. During the Games, all participants were managed in a closed loop that sealed them off from the general public. They commuted through designated shuttle buses that connected different facilities within the "bubble." Every participant was tested on a daily basis to quickly identify any infections within the loop. President of the International Olympic Committee Thomas Bach hailed the closed-loop management system as "very successful as it has made everyone in the bubble feel safe and comfortable."
