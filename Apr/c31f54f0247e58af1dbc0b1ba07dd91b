As millions of people in east China's Shanghai are under closed-off community management amid a surge of COVID-19, a small group of people have stepped up voluntarily to help deliver food, medicines and other essentials to their neighbors.Hong Shu leads a volunteer medical squad for a closed-off community of 8,000 residents in Shanghai's Xuhui District. Living in Huaqin Community herself, Hong and her team members make hundreds of medicine deliveries each day for their neighbors, especially for the elderly with chronic diseases.Buying hundreds of medicines from hospitals and dispatching them to each household in the community every day is never an easy job. But Hong sees it differently and takes it as a divine mission.
