The head of the International Atomic Energy Agency Rafael Grossi said on Thursday that radiation levels in "excavations" found in the exclusion zone around the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant were well below the maximum authorized levels for plant workers. Ukraine's state power company said after Russian troops withdrew at the end of March that they received "significant doses" of radiation from digging trenches in the area.
