China and Ghana should strengthen cooperation and work together to safeguard international fairness and justice as well as the interests of both countries and the rest of the developing world, Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Tuesday. During a phone call with Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley Ayorkor Botchway, Wang said the two countries should also jointly reject hegemony and power politics. He congratulated Ghana on serving as a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council for the 2022-2023 term, adding that the Chinese side is pleased to see the West African country playing a more active role in international and regional affairs. China welcomes Ghana to join the Group of Friends of Global Development Initiative that China launched within the UN framework in January with the aim of supporting developing countries to strive for post-COVID-19 recovery, said Wang. "China's vote at the UN will always belong to developing countries and to our African brothers," he said. The Chinese foreign minister also pledged that China will always be a trustworthy partner in the development of Ghana as well as Africa at large. Botchway, for her part, said Ghana values the friendship with China and firmly adheres to the one-China policy. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, African countries have realized more clearly that the world is not fair, development is not balanced, and China is a real friend that Africa can rely on, said Botchway. As a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council and the chair of the Economic Community of West African States, Ghana is ready to strengthen communication and coordination with China on international and regional issues to better implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and build a fairer and more just world, she said.
