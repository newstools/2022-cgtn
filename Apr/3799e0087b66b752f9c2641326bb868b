China on Wednesday "strongly denounced" the terrorist attack that took place in the Confucius Institute at Karachi University of Pakistan, urging thorough investigation and "severe punishment" for the terrorists. Three Chinese nationals were killed, with several casualties. "This was a deliberately planned suicide terrorist attack targeting Chinese nationals," said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin during a regular press briefing. "The terrorists directly put their targets against teachers, who are inheritors of human civilization and promoters of cultural exchanges," he added. "China expresses strong condemnation and great indignation to such acts." The Chinese embassy and consulates in Pakistan have launched an emergency plan, requesting Pakistan to make every effort to treat the wounded, thoroughly investigate the attack, and severely punish the perpetrators. After the incident, Pakistani Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif visited the Chinese Embassy in Islamabad on Tuesday afternoon to express his condolences to the families of the victims and the government and people of China. The prime minister said he has instructed that the attack be thoroughly investigated and the perpetrators brought to justice, adding that the Pakistani side will provide all possible assistance to the injured. Pakistan condemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations, said Shahbaz, adding that such vicious acts against the all-weather strategic cooperative partnership between Pakistan and China will never dent the iron brotherhood between the two countries, nor hinder bilateral cooperation.
