UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that people who sought to "abuse" Britain's immigration system would be deported to a third country or their country of origin. "We must ensure that the only route to asylum in the UK is a safe and legal one and that those who tried to jump the queue or abuse our systems will find no automatic path to set them up in our country but rather be swiftly and humanely removed to a safe third country or their country of origin," Johnson remarked. He made the comments while announcing the government's new immigration arrangement with Rwanda.
