You Lu, 27, works as a stand-in tomb-sweeper at the Ling An Cemetery. She has completed 200 services since starting her job in 2018. In her eyes, her work is not just a paid service, but also an extension of her clients' care for their departed loved ones. "To be a stand-in tomb-sweeper is not only acting as a substitute, but an extension of the clients' respect and love for their loved ones. We are the bridge in conveying their thoughts," she said. Since the cemetery began promoting this service in 2017, there have been six stand-in tomb-sweepers and 600 stand-in services.
