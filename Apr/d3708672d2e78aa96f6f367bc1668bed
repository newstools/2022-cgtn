British Virgin Islands (BVI) Premier Andrew Fahie and BVI Port Authority Managing Director Oleanvine Maynard were arrested on Thursday at a Miami-area airport on charges of conspiring to traffic cocaine, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has said. DEA agents at the Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport took Fahie and Maynard into custody after they allegedly agreed to accept money from undercover agents posing as Mexican drug traffickers, the Miami Herald newspaper reported. Fahie and Maynard were to inspect a plane carrying $700,000 that they would receive in exchange for facilitating cocaine shipments through their Caribbean territory, reported the Herald, citing U.S. authorities.
