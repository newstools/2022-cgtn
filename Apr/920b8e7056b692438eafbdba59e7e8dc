Several countries, mostly European Union and NATO members that are supporting Ukraine in its conflict against Russia, are sending their diplomats back to Kyiv. The UK plans to reopen its embassy next week. The Netherlands has also sent diplomats back to Ukraine but they are operating from Lviv in the far west of the country with a limited number of staff. The United States said it was assessing the security situation before it decides on reopening its embassy.
