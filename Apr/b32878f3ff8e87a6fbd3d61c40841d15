Changes in the reserve requirement ratio (RRR) for banks, announced by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), came into effect on Monday. Through this move, the PBOC is expecting to release long-term liquidity of 530 billion yuan ($83.2 billion) into the interbank system to support the Chinese economy amid growing headwinds. In this episode of BizBeat, CGTN's Aaron Liu explains that the RRR cut is aimed at shoring up support for the real economy, and the PBOC will continue to implement prudent monetary policy.
