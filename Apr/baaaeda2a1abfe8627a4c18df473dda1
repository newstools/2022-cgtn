Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Qin Gang on Thursday called on China and the U.S. to strengthen cooperation in agricultural sustainable development during a speech at the second leg of his mid-western states tour in America. "Coming to Iowa gives me a great opportunity to see for myself the boundless black soil, and have a hands-on experience of the down-to-earth and refreshing farm work here," Qin said at the 2022 U.S.-China High Level Agricultural Dialogue. The state of Iowa is among the top producers of America's corn and pork. "China and the U.S. are naturally compatible and complementary with each other in agricultural trade, and our potential for agricultural cooperation is unlimited," the ambassador pointed out. "We need to strengthen cooperation in science, technology and education, focus on sustainable development, reinforce technological support, and cultivate young agricultural scientists and technicians." Qin also stressed the need for enhancing information exchanges and the restoration the agricultural dialogue mechanism "as soon as possible."
