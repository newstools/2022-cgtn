The exhibition "Edo Fantasy" in Beijing displays 140 sets of classic ukiyo-e woodblock prints at the China Millennium Monument, celebrating the 50th anniversary of the normalization of China-Japan diplomatic relations. Let's head into the world of the Ukiyo-e, a distinctive Japanese art style from the Edo period that's highly admired by many, including the revered Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh, who was so mesmerized that he even incorporated some of the Japanese techniques in his artworks. Reporter Ding Siyue takes us there.
