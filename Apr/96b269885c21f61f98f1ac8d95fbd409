China condemned U.S. Navy's destroyer USS Sampson transition through Taiwan Straits and vowed to resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity, Senior Colonel Shi Yi, spokesperson for the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Eastern Theater Command, said on Wednesday. The latest passage by a U.S. Navy ship through the Taiwan Straits is a provocation that undermined peace and stability in China's Taiwan region. The PLA Eastern Theater Command remains on high alert and conducted naval and air forces to patrol with combat readiness in the Taiwan Straits.
