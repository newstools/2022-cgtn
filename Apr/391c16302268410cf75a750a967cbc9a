The security cooperation between the Solomon Islands and China isn't equal to the militarization of the Pacific region, said Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of the Solomon Islands, on Friday, Spanish international news agency EFE reported. "Solomon Islands has been a victim of war. We were chosen as the scene of military confrontation (during World War II)... It is not necessary to be reminded of the effects of war," Sogavare said, denying that the pact with China could lead to military tensions. The two countries signed an intergovernmental framework agreement on security cooperation in late March.
