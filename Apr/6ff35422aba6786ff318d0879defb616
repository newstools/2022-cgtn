Ten people sustained bullet wounds after a man opened fire at a crowded subway train in Brooklyn, New York City, during rush hours on Tuesday morning, local authorities told a press conference. The incident took place at 8:24 a.m. when a man set off two smoke bombs that dispensed smoke throughout the subway car and fired 33 shots. In addition to the 10 gunshot victims, 13 others were injured as they tried to get out of the station or suffered smoke inhalation, according to officials, adding that none of the injured was critical. Police later recovered a Glock 17 nine-millimeter handgun, three additional ammunition magazines and a hatchet from the scene. Motive of the suspect, who remains at large, is unclear. Police earlier said they also found a U-Haul key at the scene which led them to the recovery of the van in Brooklyn, rented in the name of Frank R. James on April 11 in Philadelphia. The man is now identified as a person of interest but police said they're still looking to determine if he has any connection to the train.
