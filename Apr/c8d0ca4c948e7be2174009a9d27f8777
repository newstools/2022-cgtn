On April 6, 2022, groups of black-capped capuchins were seen enjoying their time foraging and playing in the warm spring breeze of the Bifengxia Zoo in Ya'an City, southwest China's Sichuan Province. The species is also known as tufted capuchins and is one of the monkeys with the most prehensile tails in the world. Netizens have also nicknamed it the "walking meme" for its hilarious, human-like "facial expressions." (All images via CFP.)
