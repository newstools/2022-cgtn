The United States and its allies are working on a new round of sanctions against Russia. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki says the new U.S. sanctions will target Russian government officials and family members, its financial institutions, and state-owned enterprises. The announcement comes as the European Commission proposed its fifth round of sanctions against Moscow. These include a ban on imports of coal from Russia, and a transaction ban on four key Russian banks, including the country's second-largest, VTB.
