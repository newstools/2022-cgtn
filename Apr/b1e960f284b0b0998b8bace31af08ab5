Iran's 250 lawmakers said on Sunday in a letter to President Ebrahim Raisi that the U.S. must make the necessary assurances to the parties based on the relevant laws of the UN Security Council to avoid future violations of the agreement. The letter also noted that Iran should have the right to export oil to any country and receive its money through the banking system. It stressed that verbal promises, including words by U.S. President Joe Biden, cannot be considered assurance. It added that the U.S. imposed new sanctions on Iranian individuals and institutions, indicating a destructive intention, during the Vienna talks. Therefore, there is a need for a clear ban on the imposition of new sanctions in the negotiations, and the U.S. should ensure that the lifted sanctions against Iran will not be reimposed.
