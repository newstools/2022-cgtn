The annual conference of the Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) on Wednesday released the Asian Economic Outlook and Integration Progress Annual Report 2022, listing six factors affecting Asia's economy this year. A number of factors are essential for assessing the economic performance in 2022, including the development of COVID-19, geopolitical tensions after the Russia-Ukraine conflict, monetary policy adjustment in the U.S. and Europe, debt problems in some economies, global supply and political regime changes in some Asian countries, according to the report. The Asian economy will still be in the process of recovery this year, but the growth rate may be moderate, the report said. The BFA Annual Conference 2022 is being held from April 20 to 22 in Bo'ao, south China's Hainan Province, under the theme "The World in COVID-19 & Beyond: Working Together for Global Development and Shared Future."
