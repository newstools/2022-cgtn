Panama's Foreign Minister Erika Mouynes recently visited Beijing and met with China's State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Panama cut ties with Taiwan and established diplomatic relations with Beijing five years ago. Since then, a number of Latin American and Caribbean countries have followed suit. CGTN anchor Wang Guan interviewed Nicole Wong, former director general of foreign policy at Panama's Foreign Ministry, to talk about China-Panama relations and the stories behind the scenes.
