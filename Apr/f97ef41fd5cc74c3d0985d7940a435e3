Ukraine has banned all imports from Russia, one of its key trading partners before the conflict with annual imports valued at about $6 billion, and called on other countries to follow and impose harsher economic sanctions on Moscow. "Ukraine sets up a full embargo on importing goods from Russia," Economy Minister Yulia Svyrydenko wrote on her Facebook page on Saturday, "We have legalized the actual termination of trade relations with the Russia Federation, which happened on February 24." The exchange of goods and services between the two neighboring countries has been virtually non-existent since Moscow launched what it called a "special military operation" in Ukraine on February 24, but Saturday's move makes the termination of imports a law. "Such a step of Ukraine can serve as an example for our Western partners and stimulate them to strengthen sanctions against Russia, including the implementation of the energy embargo and isolation of all Russian banks." Ukraine's imports from Russia stood at $5.85 billion in 2021, and its exports to Russia were worth $3.35 billion in the same year, according to UN trade data. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has repeatedly called on the West to boycott Russian exports. The West has imposed numerous measures on Russia that have already isolated Moscow to a degree never before experienced by such a large economy and on Saturday British Prime Premier Boris Johnson said more sanctions are to come.
