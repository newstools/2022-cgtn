China's first domestic mass production of carbon-14, a radioactive isotope of carbon, was launched on Tuesday at the China National Nuclear Corporation's Qinshan nuclear power plant in east China's Jiaxing City. The production process applies an internal nuclear reaction via commercial nuclear power units, which can produce large amounts of stable carbon-14 on a long-term basis. China's carbon-14 supply presently largely relies on imports from other countries, which is both costly and uncertain. Mass production of homegrown carbon-14 will ensure China can be self-sufficient in its carbon-14 supply, and will also bolster the development of an industrial chain of isotope applications.
