The Chinese women's volleyball team has completed its 46-day training in Ningbo, with the newest squad list expected to be announced in the coming days. 67 players from around the country were called up on February 17, but only 55 made it to the end and took part in the final physical fitness tests over the weekend. The players, divided into nine groups, had to do 10 exercises including push-ups, sit-ups, kettle bell swings and timed runs. The results will serve as important reference data for team coach Cai Bin, who is two months into his second spell leading the team as they prepare for this year's Nations League, Hangzhou Asian Games, and World Championships.
