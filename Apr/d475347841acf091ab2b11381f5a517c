As a typical alpine animal, the blue sheep, or bharal, has a stout figure. Its strong hooves allow it to scamper up to the precipitous cliffs in Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China's Sichuan Province. Their grayish or taupe coat enable it to blend perfectly into the rocky slopes and cliffs. In the summer, the blue sheep prefers to eat fresh leaves on gentle slopes where the vegetation is flourishing. When the winter comes, it forages on mosses and lichens on the steep rocks as a substitute. The blue sheep is under second-class state protection in China.
