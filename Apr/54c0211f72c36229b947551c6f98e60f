China is willing to increase cooperation with Portuguese-speaking countries (PSCs) in vaccines, medication and health and set up a communication center on epidemic prevention in China's Macao Special Administrative Region, said Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Sunday. He made the remarks online while attending the opening ceremony of a special ministerial conference of the Forum for Economic and Trade Cooperation between China and PSCs, also known as Forum Macao. Noting that Macao is a bridge connecting China and PSCs, Li said that the central government supports it in further developing a service platform for business cooperation between China and PSCs. The central government has unswervingly implemented the principles of "One Country, Two Systems" and "Macao people governing Macao" with a high degree of autonomy, he said. Trade between China and PSCs has exceeded $100 billion for five consecutive years and reached $200 billion last year, which fully demonstrated the resilience and potential of cooperation, Li noted. China would make more contributions to safeguarding world peace and promoting mutual development and prosperity of all countries together with PSCs and the international society. Calling for further enhancing trade and investment liberalization and facilitation, Li said China is willing to improve collaboration in advancing infrastructure connectivity, industrial capacity, energy conservation, and environmental protection with PSCs. Government delegates from China and eight PSCs, including Angola, Brazil, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, and Timor-Leste, attended the meeting.
