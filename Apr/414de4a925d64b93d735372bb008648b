The bombardment of Mariupol continued after the assault on the Azovstal steel plant stopped, but the red zone around the plant was noticeably quieter. The city is gradually clearing debris from damaged buildings, the first being the Mariupol Theater. The local emergency department said the side of the theater facing the steel plant needed to be demolished as soon as possible. Residents spoke with CGTN correspondent Dmitriy Maslak, saying they wanted the theater torn down as it had become a symbol of the city's misery and suffering. Meanwhile, Maslak found life returning to normal gradually, with more people and cars on the streets and communications slowly returning.
