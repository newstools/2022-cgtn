Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan said in parliament on Wednesday that normalization of relations with Turkey must take place without pre-conditions, Armenian news agency Armenpress reported. "If the Armenia-Turkey normalization process doesn't give swift results, there is a big chance that it will get stalled," Pashinyan said, adding the two sides "have agreed that the process must take place without pre-conditions and the Armenian side is continuing with this logic." Pashinyan also noted that the preparation of the peace process between Georgia and Armenia should start immediately and he hoped that the foreign ministries of the two countries will be able to fulfill the given instructions in due time.
