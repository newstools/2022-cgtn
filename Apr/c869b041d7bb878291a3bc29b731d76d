It's common to see large families of golden snub-nosed monkeys in Wolong National Nature Reserve, southwest China's Sichuan Province. Each family usually consists of one male, five to 10 females, and several cubs. The family members take care of each other, and forage together. They feed on a variety of vegetation, like sprouts, leaves, barks and flowers. Sometimes, they even catch fledglings and insects, and eat eggs. The golden snub-nosed monkeys are also neighbors of the giant pandas in Wolong's forests. They are both under first-class state protection in China.
