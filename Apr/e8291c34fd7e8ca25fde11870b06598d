Crisis-hit Sri Lanka's stock exchange halted again Monday after a nearly 13-percent plunge. The island nation is grappling with its worst economic downturn since independence in 1948, with months of regular blackouts and shortages of food and fuel.

Shares continued their rapid slide after a brief resumption, prompting the market to declare a halt to trading for the rest of the day. Read more: What has caused Sri Lanka's economic crisis?
