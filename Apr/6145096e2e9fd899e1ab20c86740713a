World Health Organization (WHO) members agreed this week to gradually raise their mandatory fees starting from 2024 as part of a funding review seen as vital to the U.N. health agency's future, Reuters reported Thursday, citing three sources. "There's a basic agreement and there is a timeline and conditions," one of the sources told Reuters. "It's a very good day for global health," he added. The agreement is in the form of a recommendation and still needs to be given formal approval by governments at the World Health Assembly next month. (WIth input from Reuters)
