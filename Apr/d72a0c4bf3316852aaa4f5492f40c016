The International Convention Center of Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) is an iconic building on Boao Dongyu Island in Qionghai City, China's southernmost Hainan Province. The center, the permanent home of BFA, is located in a multi-functional tourist destination with beach, forest, hot springs and idyllic scenery. To reach the International Convention Center, take Bus No.2 at Qionghai Bus Station and get off at the Boao watertown forum site; the center is within walking distance. More people choose to use new energy vehicles for low-carbon travel, which coincides with the green organizing concept. The 2022 annual BFA conference will take place online and offline April 20-22 under the theme "The World in COVID-19 & Beyond: Working Together for Global Development and Shared Future."
