China launched a new Earth-observation satellite from the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwestern China on Thursday. The satellite, Gaofen-3 03, was launched by a Long March-4C rocket at 7:47 a.m. (Beijing Time) and entered the planned orbit successfully. It is mainly used to obtain reliable and stable high-resolution SAR images and to provide operational application data support for China's marine development, terrestrial environmental resource monitoring and emergency disaster prevention and mitigation. The launch marks the 414th mission for the Long March series carrier rockets. (With input from Xinhua)
