Ye Guangfu, taikonaut from China's Shenzhou-13 manned spaceflight mission, made his first appearance out of the return capsule after safely landing back on Earth on Saturday. Ye said the six-month stay in space was a challenge as this was his first spaceflight but he has made his dream of flying to the space come true.
