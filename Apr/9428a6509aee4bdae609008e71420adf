Chinese President Xi Jinping has hailed the massive legacy of the 2022 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, noting the Games helped engage more than 300 million people in winter sports and served as a catalyst to promote sustainable economic growth both in Beijing and the Chinese capital's surrounding areas. "Since China won the bid to host the Games, we have constructed a large number of top-notch ice and snow sports venues and facilities, and organized a series of popular winter sports events," Xi said during an awards ceremony on Friday that celebrated Beijing 2022 heroes. "People's enthusiasm in participating in winter sports continues to skyrocket, with the number of participants reaching 346 million," he added.  "The preparation and hosting of Beijing 2022 have comprehensively spurred social development, with the human rights of people with disabilities better protected and the everyday life of the general public more colorful." Xi highlighted the lasting impact of the Winter Olympics and Paralympics, which has served as a driving force for coordinated development in Beijing, Tianjin and Hebei Province. "China's regional transportation has become more convenient, the ecological environment has made significant improvements, industrial coordination has become more efficient, and the public services have turned more balanced," he said. Xi noted that the success of Beijing 2022 "lies not only in the smooth running of the events, but also in the fact that the Games have boosted every aspect of social growth and brought far-reaching positive effects to the development of the economy and society." The Chinese president also pointed out that staging the Games was an important path to improving people's well-being and fulfilling their aspirations for a better life. "We have made people physically and mentally healthier, more fully employed, and far better off," he said.
