The prevalence of COVID-19 in the UK has reached record levels, with about 1 in 13 people estimated to be infected with the virus in the past week, according to the latest figures from Britain's official statistics agency. Some 4.9 million people were estimated to have the coronavirus in the week ending March 26, up from 4.3 million recorded in the previous week, the Office for National Statistics said Friday. The latest surge is driven by the more transmissible Omicron variant BA.2, which is the dominant variant across the UK. Hospitalizations and death rates are again rising, although the number of people dying from COVID-19 is still relatively low compared with earlier this year. Nonetheless, the latest estimates suggest that the steep climb in new infections since late February, when British Prime Minister Boris Johnson scrapped all remaining coronavirus restrictions in England, has continued well into March. The figures came on the same day the government ended free rapid COVID-19 tests for most people in England under Johnson's "living with COVID" plan. People who do not have health conditions that make them more vulnerable to the virus now need to pay for tests to find out if they have the virus. "The government's 'living with COVID' strategy of removing any mitigations, isolation, free testing and a considerable slice of our surveillance amounts to nothing more than ignoring this virus going forwards," said Stephen Griffin, associate professor at the University of Leeds' medical school. "Such unchecked prevalence endangers the protection afforded by our vaccines," he said. At the same time, a new mutation of the coronavirus, XE, which was first detected in the UK on January 19, is spreading, with more than 600 cases confirmed so far. According to the World Health Organization, XE is 10 percent more transmissible than the BA.2 sub-variant of Omicron. (With input from AP)
