Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said on Tuesday that no one wants to see the outbreak of World War III, and that China supports the settlement of the conflict in Ukraine through diplomacy. Wang said, "All parties should first support dialogue and negotiation to prevent the conflict from escalating, to avoid Europe and the world paying a greater price."
