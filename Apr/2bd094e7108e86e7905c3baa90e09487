A team from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board arrived in China on Saturday to help investigate the crash of a China Eastern Airlines Boeing 737-800 passenger plane on March 21, reported CAAC News, a publication under the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC). The Boeing 737-800 aircraft crashed into a mountainous area in southern China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, killing all 132 people on board, which was China's deadliest aviation disaster in 28 years. According to the requirements of the Convention on International Civil Aviation, the U.S., which is a member of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the country that designed and manufactured the Boeing 737-800 aircraft, can participate in the investigation of the accident, the CAAC News report said. The U.S. team consists of seven authorized representatives and technical advisors. Their major responsibility is to provide technical support in investigating the cause of the accident from the perspective of the designer and manufacturer of the plane, according to the report. On the day of the plane crash, the CAAC notified the ICAO and the NTSB about the basic information of the accident as per relevant procedures, and the NTSB expressed willingness to provide technical support to the investigation. The two sides have been in close contact on the specific arrangements for the U.S. personnel to come to China. The NTSB said on its Twitter account that "investigators will limit interactions with those outside of investigation similar to safety protocols at Beijing Olympics, which will allow them to begin work immediately without a quarantine."
