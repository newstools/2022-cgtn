The town of Irpin, northwest of Ukrainian capital Kyiv, was badly damaged during the Russia-Ukraine conflict. CGTN correspondent Lina Mironova interviewed some refugees who evacuated from Irpin to western Ukraine. Some had moved to Irpin from Donetsk a few years ago, then bought and renovated houses, but now they're separated from their families due to the conflict. Some of the houses were damaged during the conflict, but can still be repaired. Children have now understood that resurrection is only possible in video games.
