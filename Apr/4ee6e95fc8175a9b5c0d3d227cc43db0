Manchester United announced on Thursday that Erik ten Hag will become the manager of the club after the end of this season until 2026. The 52-year-old Dutchman will become the fifth formal manager of the "Red Devils" after Sir Alex Ferguson. David Moyes, Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer have worked in that position before ten Hag and none of them were close to being successful. During his five seasons with Ajax, ten Hag helped the club win two Eredivisie championships and two KNVB Cup titles. He led them to the UEFA Champions League semifinals in 2019.
