A tropical storm in the Philippines unleashed floods and set off landslides over the weekend, leaving at least three dead, the country's disaster relief authorities said on Monday, adding the toll still needs further verification. Meanwhile, two other people were injured, over 136,000 people were affected, and more than 13,000 were relocated. Megi made landfall in the central Philippine province on Sunday morning and is downgraded from tropical storm to tropical depression now.
