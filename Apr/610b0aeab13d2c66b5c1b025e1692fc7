Clashes erupted on early Friday as Israeli forces stormed the grounds of Al-Aqsa Mosque, a major holy site in Jerusalem, and fired tear gas and stun grenades at worshipers, according to local media. AFP news agency reported that around 152 people were injured during the clashes, citing medics. Israeli police said some Palestinians barricaded themselves inside the mosque and hurled stones as officers tried entering the Temple Mount to disperse protesters. Three Israeli officers were lightly wounded after being pelted with stones, the report added. Meanwhile, Israel's Foreign Ministry denied that police forces had entered the mosque. "Contrary to FAKE reports, police forces DID NOT enter the mosque," it said on Twitter.
