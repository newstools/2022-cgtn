Snow partridges are one of the few wildlife species that live at an altitude of 4,200 meters in Wolong National Nature Reserve in southwest China's Sichuan Province. They brave strong winds, harsh ultraviolet rays and extreme weather and feed on mosses and ferns. Male and female snow partridges look similar in plumage but males have spurs on their tarsus. Their brown and grey feathers help them blend naturally into the surroundings. It's hard for local rangers to locate them when they are silent. Apart from the breeding season, snow partridges often forage in a group of over 10.
