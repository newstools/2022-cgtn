Ukraine claims its troops have regained control of the whole Kyiv region. Russia earlier said it was scaling down its military operations around the Ukrainian capital and the north of the country. In southeast Ukraine, the International Committee of the Red Cross said the operation was underway to help people out of the port city Mariupol. The UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Martin Griffiths will travel to Moscow on Sunday, then visit Kyiv.
