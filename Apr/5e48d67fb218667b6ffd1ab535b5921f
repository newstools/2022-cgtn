"We never thought that one day, having a peaceful sky would be such a big thing. I'm waiting for the conflict to end soon," Anna, a Krivoy Rog refugee, told CGTN about her current situation in Ukraine. Alexandra, a refugee from the Kyiv region, said the most important thing for her is that her loved ones are alive. The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has been ongoing for over a month. While some refugees are eagerly preparing to go home, other people continue to flee.
