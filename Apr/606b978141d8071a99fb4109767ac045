The 19th Asian Games and the Asian Para Games will be held in Hangzhou, provincial capital of east China's Zhejiang Province, from September 10 to 25. Throughout the games, all competition venues will use green electricity, including the electricity generated by State Grid's 136 distributed photovoltaic power stations in Hangzhou. To ensure regular supply of green electricity for the games, the Zhejiang electric power trading center has organized two power trading events to transmit green electricity produced in northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu provinces to the venues in Hangzhou and five co-host cities in Zhejiang.
