Kim Jong Un, the top leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), attended a large-scale civilian rally and parade in central Pyongyang on Friday, the official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) reported on Saturday. The parade was held to celebrate the Day of the Sun, a national holiday marking the 110th anniversary of the birth of late founder Kim Il Sung this year. The festival "artistically depicted" Kim Il Sung's native home and "the sacred mountain of revolution, Mt Paektu," according to KCNA. Kim Jong Un visited his grandfather's mausoleum, and attended a "national meeting and a public procession" in Pyongyang's Kim Il Sung Square, but gave no reported public remarks. A senior official spoke at the meeting, saying that the DPRK would overcome all difficulties and will always emerge victorious, KCNA said. (With input from Reuters)
