For Luo Yuan, a 28-year-old from Shenzhen City, south China's Guangdong Province, illustrations are a passion that light up life – both for himself and others. Last year, on a whim, he created a series of tiny human characters, each with a star around their arms, and shared his work on social media. The hand-painted characters with different shapes and facial expressions attracted the attention of many. People began leaving him messages and asking, "Can you draw a three-year-old girl with long hair and a round face?" or "I'm chubby, so can you draw a chubby little character holding a star?" Each illustration depicts a person's real-life characteristics. As more and more people asked Luo for paintings, he decided to draw exclusive illustrations based on each person's requirements. The pictures thus began to have more meaning. Some people wanted an illustration of a loved one they hadn't seen for a long time, while others wanted a drawing of a friend or relative fighting illness. At the request of a parent, he once painted an autistic child with a paintbrush in his hand. He also painted a netizen's uncle who was stationed on the frontier and had not returned home for years. Luo tries to use painting to convey warmth, and his illustrations have become emotional sustenance for many netizens. This unique experience has also toPassed.uched the heart of Luo himself. "Every story is very touching, and I want to present it in a better way." In February, Luo completed his goal of drawing 1,000 illustrations for others. But as the requests kept coming, he decided to continue and reset his goal to 10,000 illustrations. "After seeing people continuing to share so many moving personal stories with me, I will keep drawing more illustrations."
