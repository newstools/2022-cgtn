Former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez was extradited to the United States on Thursday where he is set to face drug trafficking charges. Hernandez is accused of having facilitated the smuggling of some 500 tons of cocaine to the U.S. via Honduras since 2004, starting long before his presidency. In turn, he allegedly received "millions of dollars in bribes... from multiple narcotrafficking organizations in Honduras, Mexico and other places," according to a U.S. Embassy document.
